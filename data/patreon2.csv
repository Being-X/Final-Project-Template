Our goal with Patreon is to create a small, intimate community where we can get to know each other better, create space for in-depth, personal discussions, and respond to specific questions and concerns you have as you navigate intersections of race, equity, parenting, and education.

To share a little bit more about ourselves, we are an 501c3 education nonprofit that equips parents and educators with tools they can use to support racial identity development, critical literacy, and equitable practices in their homes and classrooms. We use critical race theory (which is intersectional) to navigate how issues of race impact young children and their identity development. Most of our work takes place off-line and is focused on critical media literacy research, teaching, advocacy, and increasing access to books that center marginalized groups.

Every person on our team is a parent of color. We are all navigating these issues right alongside you and bring our experiential knowledge and insight to the table, along with our educational and professional qualifications. We all hold graduate degrees and our directors include PhD candidates in Education, HBCU Professors, critical race researchers, and practitioners who each bring over a decade of experience to this work. Our work has been featured by Google, Nickelodeon, the Washington Post, Instagram, Forbes, Teaching Tolerance, People Magazine, School Library Journal, Parents, and NPR CodeSwitch. 

It will allow us to:
-Create a precedent that values and compensates educators of color for our time, labor, and experiential knowledge
-Continue our work and presence on social media to share free resources, books, and information on a daily basis
-Support our partnerships and book donations to Title I schools across the country 
-Engage in more original research. In 2019, we published our Research on Diversity in Children‚Äôs Literature  on Dr. Seuss. There are many other critical research projects we can‚Äôt wait to accomplish with your support
-Dedicate our time and energy to our work, rather than seeking and worrying about the resources needed to fund it

Thank you for joining us and being a part of this beautiful community. We appreciate your presence and can‚Äôt wait to connect on a deeper level in this space!

If you would like to support our work with a one-time contribution instead of becoming a monthly patron, you can do so  Any and all support is invaluable to us."

here we are again‚Ä¶.! the next frontier of crowdfunding, the future of sustainable art, the final exam in asking & giving, whatever you wanna call it‚Ä¶.this is it, we‚Äôre doin‚Äô it.

ever since i launched this patreon community over four years ago (!), i‚Äôve been trying to find a succinct way of explaining what it is. this patreon is for people who want to help sustain my ability and freedom to MAKE WHAT I WANT, WHEN I WANT ‚Äì liberated from commercial interests ‚Äì by paying me a set amount of money every time i create something.

for an overview of how patreon works in general, they‚Äôve got a great primer HERE to explain how it works. but basically: you give patreon your credit card # (or paypal) and you‚Äôre charged $1 (or more, if you choose) at the end every month to support me and my collaborators in our general art-making undertakings. your support also helps me to pay my general costs-of-doing-business (my office, my staff, all of life).

THE VIDEO UP TOP explains a lot about what i‚Äôve been up to here over the last few years, and how wonderful the effects have been.

as of this writing, there's over 14,000 amazing, unique patrons here and i am perpetually in awe and profoundly grateful that it‚Äôs working. it‚Äôs changed the way i write, produce and release music...it‚Äôs just inspired the hell out of me and a lot of people here on this page, and mark my words, we‚Äôre just getting started.

if you wanna, go look at this LIST OF THINGS that i‚Äôve released via the patreon over the last few years:


as you can see, there‚Äôs over 100 (whaaaa!) things, ranging from , to , to , to , to about weird charity performance art projects that support libraries, to anti-trump , to made using old voice memos i left for myself in the middle of the night so i wouldn‚Äôt forget the weird & emotionally revealing shit my weird husband mumbles in his sleep. all of this work has employed HUNDREDS of other musicians, filmmakers, engineers, graphic designers, painters, you name it‚Ä¶.we‚Äôve become our own little organic-art-farm ecosystem.

the main thing to keep in mind as you look at this list is that ALMOST NONE OF THIS WORK IS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE! there‚Äôs really just no way in today‚Äôs marketplace to ‚Äúmake a profit‚Äù from a youtube video with just a few thousand views, or a webcast of a beautiful orchestra show, or a weird animation (which are very time-consuming and expensive to produce) unless you‚Äôre a *massive* mainstream artist putting up huge paywalls and/or selling your soul to corporate advertisers. i don‚Äôt wanna do that, that‚Äôs not who i am.

now, a little backstory.
back in 2012, when i broke free of my soul-sucking major label and used kickstarter to sell my record ‚Äútheatre is evil‚Äù (which ), people were still getting the gist of crowdfunding and patronage. nowadays people are really getting it: artists need ongoing, reliable support ‚Äì akin to a salary in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù ‚Äì if they‚Äôre going to make it and be happy, working artists. the internet and micropayments are making that possible.

patreon is a great platform for organizing this concept, including the huge advantage that patrons on a budget (who can only afford $1 per month) don‚Äôt have to worry about getting charged too much, whereas people with a lot to give (i have a few $100 and $1,000 patrons) are also welcome to support, without expecting huge amounts of time-sinking rewards which drain energy from the artist.

i treasure my $1 patrons as much as my $1,000 patrons. it‚Äôs like the obama campaign: every goddamn dollar counts. it‚Äôs also sort of like NPR (that‚Äôs american for ‚ÄúNational Public Radio‚Äù, for you foreigners): even though you donate, nobody expects you to be glued and tuned into the radio 24/7 just because you made an annual donation. you donated BECAUSE YOU WANT EVERYONE ELSE to be able to enjoy the top-quality (and free) content that NPR provides. this is a community. everybody pitches in what they can, and i try to keep my content as free as possible, so that EVERYBODY, even the people who cannot afford to be part of this patreon, can enjoy my songwriting and my other artistic undertakings.

more good news: i‚Äôm also able to employ a TON of other artists, which in these dying days of arts-funding feels really wonderful and satisfying. as far as that goes, you‚Äôre trusting me to be a curator and choose where to spread your money around, so it trickles into improving the lives of a ton of other artists, creators and makers.

call me a commun-ist or a social-ist if you want. mostly i‚Äôm just an art-ist that thinks that art is for sharing, not for selling.

this patreon is my starting point, my homebase, my workshop where everything happens in transparent realtime. sometimes i take my finished work and haul it onto the art-wagon and traipse it out into the world marketplace (i.e. i work with real labels/distributors/publicists, etc). i‚Äôm planning to do this in 2019 with a GIANT NEW ALBUM. but mostly, those moments are few and far between and don‚Äôt cover the rent and the costs of being a full-time artist with a full-time office and a full-time team.

the feedback from the patrons already gathered here has been SO HELPFUL. my patrons have gotten to know me and my team INTIMATELY; how we work, how i work, how it ALL works. we all talk a lot. even though my team sometimes stumbles in the dark and makes mistakes, and even though not everybody subscribing to the patreon LOVES every little thing i produce (how could they??) this system is working BEAUTIFULLY. It‚Äôs HUMAN. i cherish and ponder feedback. we are figuring this system out as we go along. it‚Äôs a constant discussion. it‚Äôs a tribe.

i blog A LOT - a few times a week, sometimes more. i talk about everything...my life, the work, my inspirations, my troubles, my process. my blogs get sent out to the patrons automatically by email (if you‚Äôve enabled email notifications), and i ask a lot of questions and i ask for a lot of input and feedback. you‚Äôre never expected to answer, but i read every comment, because i care a shit-ton about this community and whether it‚Äôs working for everybody.

if you guys know me, you know i LISTEN. we're here to make this work, and we will. not a lot of songwriters are using this platform, but more are joining every day, and this community is kind of a trail-blazer, since we are making up the rules as we go along.

so. whether you‚Äôve been a fan of mine since the days of The Dresden Dolls or whether you‚Äôve just recently found me through my book, (which is about EXACTLY this topic of art and asking) or you‚Äôve stumbled across my songs or videos online, i would love to invite you to join this community and see what we are doing.

and if you‚Äôre already one of my patrons...THANK YOU. i love you and you are making me possible.

and now‚Ä¶..

After making a grisly discovery in the countryside, a small town book editor‚Äôs life gets entangled with a young Mafia lord and his intimidating bodyguard...even as every step she takes draws her deeper into the dangerous underworld of the city.




On her way to an arranged marriage, a haughty princess is ambushed and held captive by bandits until she is rescued by a tired, hungry and pissed off soldier. All the accidental knight-in-shining-armour wants is to get some sleep after returning from the battlefield - but having a beautiful princess in tow is making it very difficult for him to do so, in more ways than one.






This tier is for you to show some love and support, and you'll have access to exclusive behind-the scenes content, news, and announcements that I do not share anywhere else.

I‚Äôm a PhD dropout who makes YouTube videos, mostly discussing Internet culture, politics, and LGBT issues. My main political goal is to counterbalance the hatred toward progressive movements that is so common online, though I'm not afraid to criticize ""my own side"" either. Stylistically, I try to appeal to a wide audience and avoid merely preaching to the choir. I try to make the videos I'd want to watch: well-produced, informative, funny, and entertaining.

And What Are You Going To Do with My Money?

Your support enables me to buy costumes, makeup, props, software, and audio/video equipment. It also now enables me to do this as a full-time job, writing, recording, editing and publishing high-quality videos.

Okay, I‚Äôm Sold. But What‚Äôs in It for Me?

Depending on their reward level, patrons get updates about what I‚Äôm working on, access to outtake/behind-the-scenes videos, participation in AMA live streams, and recognition in my video credits.



The traditional goal is one video per month. As my productions have expanded in length/ambition, the actual rate of my video releases is more like once every six weeks."

MeshedVR is a small indie developer that enjoys advancing state-of-the-art technology in the upcoming field of VR. Our 1st project has focused on advancing character simulation, and a natural outlet of that work is a VR sex simulator! Our Patreon will therefore be dedicated to creating adult VR games utilizing the technology that we have developed and to continue to push the cutting-edge of what is possible to bring you the most realistic sex simulator possible. Virt-a-Mate (VaM for short) is our first sex simulator project designed to meet that goal.

IMPORTANT! Requirements for running Virt-A-Mate (VaM)
VaM requires a Windows PC (Windows 10 recommended) with a DirectX11 compatible video card to run. VaM does not run on MacOS, and does not run natively on Oculus Quest. Oculus Quest can work if used with Oculus Link cable and system. VaM was built for VR, but can also run in a desktop mode. VaM has steep PC requirements due to nature of extensive body physics system and simulated hair and clothing systems. Recommended: Intel i7-7XXX series or higher (3.6 Ghz or higher), Nvidia 1080Ti GPU or higher, 16GB RAM or higher. VaM favors high single-thread CPU performance for overall framerate, but does utilize all CPU cores to an extent. In many cases today, this favors Intel CPUs. VaM hair and cloth simulation also tend to run better on Nvidia GPUs at this time due to how they seem to handle computer shaders more efficiently. A goal of the 2.X version of VaM it to be optimized for a broader range of hardware and offer performance scaling features to enable use on lower-end hardware.

Virt-A-Mate is our first project. It is an adults-only virtual reality sex simulator and sandbox. The goal of this project was to make realistic characters using a combination of realistic joint physics, soft body physics, skin-accurate collisions, and advanced rendering techniques. The characters can come alive by capturing and storing motion capture from off-the-shelf VR controllers like the Vive controllers or Oculus Touch controllers. The characters can react to your movements or objects you control in a realistic manner.

Virt-A-Mate in it's current state is meant as a creative tool for making adult content, but plenty of ready-to-use content is available from the community on the official Discord server (you have option to connect to Discord server after backing) or at the upcoming VaM Hub site.

Virt-A-Mate also includes a desktop mode for those without VR and also for making it easier to make some content. A lot of users use desktop mode to create a significant portion of a scene and then use VR mode to experience their creation.


Newer versions of VaM require the use of an updater. This public post will be kept up-to-date with latest information on downloading and installing through the updater:

Each week - we work tirelessly to bring you 5+ hours of content. We started with Crime in Sports, and because of all of you guys, we have been able to start Small Town Murder. 

We live for this stuff. We've been having a lot of fun doing it for the past 3 years and we enjoy spending time with you at home, on your commutes, during your workouts, or during work hours. 

""How can I help?"" Well...if you can chip in a couple bucks every now and again, we can try to expand the operation MORE! 

** Don't worry!  The show will always be free. **

But we want to grow (and keep the lights on)!  

Obviously, we don't expect, or assume anyone will contribute to this crazy thing we love doing so much, other than just listening to us every week! Any donation we do receive goes toward creating the best and highest quality content possible -- sound equipment for the studio, research tools, editing, traveling for live shows, etc. (and we are working on how to create more bonus content!) 

If you are new to our crew, you may notice that there are not very many bonus episodes on Patreon; and there may be a few weeks where we do not post any bonus content... but that does not mean we are not working hard on stuff behind the scenes! 

In our ideal world, we'd love to be able to meet each and every one of you maniacs. And with your help, we'd like to make that happen.

Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate each and every one of you!

My Name's Sakimichan: ) I've been drawing on paper since I was a kid and I've never loved any other hobbies as much. I started to digital paint when I was 13. Here's a little comparison to what I was able to do back then.

I have always loved drawing because it was my escape from difficult times so natural I fell in love with digital painting. I still remember the struggle when I was working on my first CG portrait. But Some persistence, handwork, practice and passion helped me along my way. Practice is key !

so much has happened since I joined patreon
Thank you guys for supporting me ! One of the best rewards I've gotten by doing this is I feel like I'm able to achieve my goals as a creator and how much it allows me to experiment and develop my style! Of course an artist's journey will never ends and I've yet to scratch the surface ! If you would like to help support me and follow my progress I'll be happy to provide some goodies in exchange !

Hbomb , Videos and Video Essays (Hbomb),"9,409",,,2173,Oct 2014,"I'm Harris Bomberguy. I live in a cabin in the woods and browse the web.
I used to have a real job, but now I make videos for the internet for some reason.


I try to cover a variety of topics- games, pop-culture, sociopolitical issues, and whatever else I happen to be obsessed with at the time. The hope is they make people interested in things they might not have been interested in before, and people who were already interested see a new side to it. Also there's at least one joke per video, I'm trying to get rid of them but they keep getting in somehow.

I aim to release around one video per month!

The content I create is often too weird, esoteric, or partisan for a mainstream audience, which is why I use Patreon to support my work.



Backers see videos a few days early, and sometimes longer. I've got a video set for Christmas 2020 that's already out for backers. Why did I do this? I don't know.

I also make a lot of extra things just for backers, like behind the scenes material or outtakes, commentaries on older videos, breakdowns of my process, and sometimes entire backer-only videos on subjects I don't think would be great for a more general audience.

Higher tier backers get their name in the credits, or can vote on what the next video will be in polls taken after the release of the last video!



Supporting me helps me take more risks with my projects - a lot of material I cover is copyrighted, and Fair Use is more of a guideline than a law, making it impossible for me to ever really profit from monetising my work. I also find myself drawn to subjects that might be too niche to be marketable to a wide audience.

With Patreon support I can afford to pay a Producer to keep current and future projects on track, and hire artists, musicians, animators, and researchers to enhance the work as much as possible.

Support also helps me get better production equipment, various props, and subscriptions to software like the Adobe Suite, which you have to pay for every month or you can't use it any more, because that's how the world works now."

We don't expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to our crazy projects than simply watching our videos. We appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, it'll all go back into creating more stuff. From time to time, the site may go a few weeks without any new videos being posted, but rest assured that just because we're not posting something doesn't mean we're not working hard on stuff behind the scenes, usually multiple projects at once because we're kind of crazy. We tend to spend longer editing our videos than it seems many other online video creators do because it's our favorite aspect and we like to get creative with it whenever possible.

We've kept our Patreon pledge tiers very low because honestly there's better things you should be spending large amounts of money on. We may change up some tiers and add some higher rewards in the future, but for right now just think of this as donations that give you a little something back as a thank you for continuing to watch and support what we do."

In a world very different from ours life was relatively peaceful between the tribal people in touch with the lush nature around them and the creatures roaming the woods and vast landscapes. The balance shifted when foreigners from different worlds worlds discovered the unspoiled environment and its inhabitants. Rogue criminals and vagabonds came to seek fortune and make a living by hunting and killing the majestic creatures and searching for rare, precious materials. Not only criminals developed an interest for the world, noble scholars started studying the world. They document and research the creatures and tribal people looking for ancient relics, witnesses to the times that were.


Become the heroine Maya - strong, beautiful and able to call upon her wings, her tribal heritage - in this gripping . Roam the world from fertile forests to dry and sun-soaked deserts, spread your wings and cut through the skies of a world torn by greed and vanity. Find your own way to ensure your survival and embrace the possibilities of fighting and sex.

Maya‚Äôs story is just the beginning. As development continues there will be more characters of different factions for you to experience. For example you could also take the role of Max, a young troublemaker from the poor regions of an industrial world, still looking for his place in life, who joined the raiders in a call for adventure. Fighting and surviving for purpose and meaning on this wild uncharted planet.
The potential is endless, so stay tuned.



The strongest elements of the game are the exploration of this untamed world and surviving its dangers. Interaction with all its inhabitants, building up sexual relationships with npcs and uncovering the story for the main character.

A warm welcome to you!
I go by the alias Dr PinkCake and I create adult Visual Novels (VNs), for a living.
I have worked as a programmer and I have a background in music, photography and digital illustration.
Developing adult games, that I've enjoyed for my entire adult life, is my creative outlet that allows me to merge all of my passions into a single project. I truly love doing this!

During 2018 I developed an episodic adult VN named Acting Lessons




Today I'm developing my second adult game, titled .
is also an episodic adult VN with the focus on storytelling, romance, humor and drama.




Ever since I was a teenager, which is a long time ago, I've really enjoyed the college comedy genre in movies. Now I get to write my own VN in that genre, fused with drama and romance. I aim to deliver memorable experiences with my creations and to get you fully immersed in the game.



This game is for adults who value story telling, branching choices, comedy and drama. There will be a good amount of sexual content in the game, but it's not the main focus. Depending on your life experiences, I would like to warn you that the story might hit close to home, at times. The general tone will be happy, but if you're in a dark period of your life, I'd advise you to not play the game.



This is the most common question I get and it isn't fun to tell you the clich√© phrase ""I'll release the update when it's ready"". It's a clich√©, but it's also the truth. As soon as I can release an update, I will release it.
I'm working full-time on the game and my PCs are rendering images 24/7.
I promise to keep patrons updated on the progress, but I cannot give accurate estimates until an update almost is ready for release. Something to bear in mind is that I'm doing this all by myself. There's no team of developers, it's just me.



I'm creating the art and animations, writing the dialogue, programming the game, finding music with correct licenses, managing the patreon page and packaging/uploading the game.

I love to do this, but please understand that it's a huge amount of work for a single person.



This work is very expensive and I need funding to complete the projects I start and since I'm doing this for a living I need an income, too. This is where you come in; you're helping the game become a reality and keeping me from going back to doing this as a hobby.
Those who were my patrons during the time I developed Acting Lessons helped me upgrade my rendering equipment and buy a lot of assets for the game development.



Without those patrons the game would have looked completely different and it might not have been completed.
Those who were my patrons during the early days of Being A DIK made it possible for me to quit my real job and work on game development full-time.
So, no matter the sum you pledge, you're not buying a game from me, you are supporting the game development and, moreover, you're motivating me to complete the projects I start.

I create these games for myself, but I love to share my creations with you.



Prices shown in the tiers are monthly donations, paid up-front, that you can stop at any time. Please check the tiers for more information on the rewards I offer for your pledge.



If you happen to like what I'm creating and want to show your appreciation through a donation, please consider being my patron. No donation is too small and every donation is appreciated.
My heartfelt thanks to you for reading my page and for playing my games!



The games produced by DrPinkCake don't include any illegal or forbidden content according to the Patreon TOS."
3Blue1Brown , videos animating math (3blue1brown),"7,901",,,1439,Oct 2016,"Home page

3blue1brown is a YouTube channel aimed at explaining math visually.

These lessons are funded directly by their viewers, primarily through Patreon. If they add value to your life, consider joining as a contributing member.  In fact, as thanks for even coming so far as to visit this page, here‚Äôs a secret video you may enjoy.

The videos are not sponsored, and I make sure you never run into ads in the middle. A model based primarily on direct payments aligns more directly with the goals of these lessons.  However, given that we all want them to be freely available, rather than creating some exclusive content behind a paywall, the way things work is that all the videos are free, and those who can afford it can choose to pay.

For a couple of years now this has been the dominant source of funding for the channel, and it's hard to overstate how liberating it is when planning out new projects.




As listed in the tiers above, there are perks, like early access to each new video, animations sneak peeks along the way, name in credits, and more. The feedback from most supporters, though, is that they contribute to say thanks for the lessons or to pay it forward for future learners, so above all the aim is to try to offer lessons you feel proud to have supported.




Sure, there‚Äôs , some , and a , if you‚Äôre into any of those. Thank you!

Just know that the Patreon page is where all supporter benefits, like early releases, are organized and published.




There is no consistent answer, but typically they take several weeks. Researching/writing each lesson can take a while since I often go through many drafts and try to test it out on people when possible. And of course, the visuals take significant time.

The hope, though, is that a good visual lesson can save orders of magnitude more time for people trying to learn a topic and that it can spark a genuine passion for the subject.




I‚Äôm glad you asked!  Viewers frequently write to tell me that these videos turned them from ambivalence, discomfort, or even disdain for math to instead loving the subject. Sometimes it started with a topic they were struggling with which the videos helped to clarify; other times it was simply seeing a creative side of the subject not often highlighted in schools. To take just an excerpt from one such email:


With each of the many notes like this, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a fuller story, perhaps an inspiring teacher or an enthusiastic peer, and these videos were just one of many factors pushing them over to the light side. Nevertheless, to think they could play even a minor role in people‚Äôs lives like this is a tremendous motivation to keep making them.




There are lots of great independent creators whose work I enjoy, like , , , , , , to name just a few. Think about whose work you enjoy the most, and which has had the most positive influence on your life. Also think about larger organizations, like , where the freedom enabled by this more direct relationship likely makes for higher quality work. What the internet looks like is a direct product of the economics underpinning it, and we as consumers play into that."

SnowFreaks , Accurate winter weather predictions with a bit of humor and fun! (SnowFreaks),"7,529",,,608,Feb 2019,"What can I say... At a very young age, I found myself being HOOKED on Winter weather, mainly, good ole fashion snow storms. When I was around 10 years old, I started actually calling all the weather offices on local news, and even reached out to a very famous meteorologist out in Chicago. I asked thousands of questions on where I can find the models, and how to read the charts, and ultimately, how to predict winter storms. It didn't come easy... But, over the years, I have become exceptionally accurate. I never went to college for weather, I am NOT a meteorologist. I AM extremely accurate. I will put my forecast up against anyone. That is pretty much what I did, and that is why my page is truly a well known page in the Detroit Metro area, even areas across the state if you want crazy accurate and always updated forecasts.

In the fall of 2013, I decided to start a Facebook page as a hobby, just making my own forecasts and predictions to see how I would. It became much more than a hobby.... The Super Bowl snow storm Southeast Michigan got in 2014 is when my page pretty much went viral. Many, people were only calling 3"" to 6"" of snow, some 5"" to 9"" - ME, well, I predicted 12"" to 18"" of snow. I'll never forget it, because at that time, i didn't have many followers at all, so many people were laughing at me saying this and saying that. However, I got the last laugh, when we got exactly, area wide, 12"" to 18"" of snow. As I type this, I am approaching 165,000 followers. My page that was once a hobby, is truly an addiction to not only myself, but for thousands of followers. That is when the name SnowFreaks was born. People just love to know all the updates, and the facts, no guessing. Many LOVE the snow, and MANY freak about the snow. So there you have it, folks!

This is a BIG passion of mine, and I am so happy I can share my skills, with so many! The support is mind blowing to me. Thank you all so much for allowing me to do what I love!

I always have and always will put GOD #1! That will never change, and I feel that is the reason, I am who I am.

So, if you want to have fun, get accurate info, and you're a good person - PLEASE support me on this journey, I will not let you down!

At this time I primarily cover most of the southern half of Michigan and NW Ohio. Message me if you are not in the area but would like to get on the journey with us!

When the snow is gone, I do plan to still update at least a couple times a week. I will not be 24/7 like I am in the Winter. However, with this incredible support I have received, and with many wanting me to stay, I am. THANK YOU ALL! Nothing but, LOVE!

SnowFreaks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

God Bless!"

Rather than just obsessively going through every single scene looking for a plot hole or continuity error that you can drive a truck through, the show offers vast, imaginative, and uproarious conversations about why certain movies work and others very much do not.

On their main feed, a new episode of the show is released every week, featuring hosts Andrew Jupin, Stephen Sajdak, Eric Szyszka, and Chris Cabin, along with occasional special guests‚Äîbut on their Patreon, there is so much more. At their highest tier, WHM provides monthly episodes on beloved animated TV shows and specials, the original Star Trek series and Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Star Wars canon of characters, and actual good movies, as well as access to their archive of over 100 early episodes, dozens of one-off specials, and quarterly commentary tracks that you can sync up with movies ranging from Predator and Commando to Twilight and the Nightmare on Elm Street remake.

As the show continues to grow, the WHM gang is continuing to add special one-offs and miniseries to their Patreon, including The Mandalorian Half-Hour, focused on all eight episodes of the first season of the titular Disney+ series, and Making It So, a Picard recap series.

And there‚Äôs so much more to come! Once you sign up, you become a genuine patron of the main show and get access to hundreds of hours of exclusive content. They hope you'll come along for the ride.

Thank you to all of you who have subscribed to the  Clickspring Youtube channel, hit the like button and taken the time to leave a comment. It's thanks to you that I am even in the position of being able to consider growing the channel via Patreon, and I want you to know how much I appreciate your support.

Why Patreon? I've been overwhelmed by the response to the project videos, and I'm at the point now where I can see an exciting future for the channel. I'd like to be able to provide a broader range of project videos, as well as release videos more frequently. I'm sure that you would already know that it takes a lot of time (and a reasonable amount of money!) to develop and make the projects, as well as shoot and edit the videos.

So I'd like your support to help me take this to the next level.

Your financial contribution will help me to buy project materials, replace worn cutters etc, as well as devote more time to the research required to develop new project ideas.

If you like the sound of that, then please show your support with a monthly pledge, and know that you are helping to create something of value for us both.

Cheers,
Chris."

I started working on SEUS in early 2012 and, while working on it, discovered a passion I never knew I had, graphics programming!

After a few years of working on SEUS, I moved on to other projects to better support myself financially. However, I just kept found myself being drawn back to it! So, I decided to go with what felt right and return to working on Minecraft shaders and create this Patreon page in the hopes that it could be sustainable for me. I can't believe how much it's grown now!


IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT MY RAY TRACING SHADER!

You're probably here for SEUS PTGI, which is my work-in-progress shader for Minecraft which features ray traced lighting and reflections. There's some important information about it that you should know before you consider becoming a patron!



As of now, As it nears completion, it will drop down to Beta status, only requiring Iron tier access. When a public release is ready, it'll be free to download for anyone! Since it is highly experimental work, I cannot provide an ETA for these milestones. Just know that I'm working as hard as I can!

. However, because I am doing a lot of tricks that most graphics programmers generally don't needto do, there might occasionally be some compatibility issues.

This isn't possible for now.

. I am currently researching how to get it running on AMD cards. I will update this section as progress is made towards this.

It is more descriptive to call the tech in SEUS PTGI ""path tracing"" (PTGI stands for Path Traced Global Illumination), It's just like how it's more descriptive to call a square a ""square"", but it is not incorrect to call it a ""polygon"".





All of my effort is being put into improving and eventually releasing SEUS PTGI, and this is possible only because of your support! Thank you so much!!"

ABOUT
Welcome to my Patreon page! My name is ICSTOR and I have been a developer of adult games for more than four years now. It has been a long journey to get to where I am now with my new successful project thanks to every Patron that joined us!

The game my team and I are working on right now is called ""Milfy City.‚Äù You can find out more information about this project below. If you like the design, please don't hesitate to pledge and help us continue working on it!

Wintergatan , Marble Machine X. Music. World Tour. (wintergatan),"5,443",,,833,Jun 2018,"Thank you for being here!
Your support will be carefully used to improve my Youtube videos and to get the Marble Machine X ready for the World Tour.

The Wintergatan Wednesdays are crowdfunded
I frequently turn down sponsorships offers for the Wednesday videos,
I am very proud that i can keep my videos focused on building and not push a lot of call to actions from other brands onto the viewers. It is thanks to all the crowdfunding support that I am able to make a decision like this and follow through on the MMX project. 

The Road Ahead towards a World Tour with Wintergatan Featuring the Marble Machine X
Here are some milestones that I am working towards - your support will be a huge help for me in each of these crucial steps:

Making the Marble Machine X look great

I just recieved all the material needed to build the perfect seamless white studio wall to to make the Wintergatan Wednesdays videos look better and to film the music videos for the Marble Machine X.

On the picture you can see the current CAD Design, I will build my wall in a corner which makes it a CYC-wall, short for Cyclorama. Onvce the wall is up i¬¥ll need to add a lot of lights to get the correct look and we need to build a rig to hang the lights in the ceiling.



My goal is to make the Marble Machine X sound great and produce music you want to listen to in your headphones without watching the videos. The Machine is not designed to be a circus act, it is designed to be a good sounding music instrument.

MMX is designed to be amplified with microphones and for that we need high quality audio equipment and help from top audio engineers for recording and touring.




Recording The album will be another long process, once the machine is ready I need to write music that lives up to the MMX Capabilities. That will be yet another longish project and I am trying to figure out how to do interesting youtube videos during that phase. 



The Marble Machine X is designed to be fully transportable. I will order high quality custom built tour cases to make sure that the Marble Machine X travels safely on the World Tour.

MMX is designed in 5 major sections that are easily detachable from each other. Each of these sections need a large and rigid tour case.
On my earlier tours I have made the habit of making use of the empty tour cases on stage during the live performance.
When touring, there is always a lot of work on getting the empty cases off the stage during the concert and then on again afterwards. Leaving the cases on the stage during the concert and having them multitask solves that. Empty cases are called ‚Äúdead cases‚Äù in the industry by the way. With continued support I can get the case designers to go that extra distance to design the cases so they can be used also in their ""dead"" state.



Since forever I have been planning how to do the start of the Wintergatan Featuring the Marble Machine X concerts.
I love that moment myself when I go to concerts, the anticipation in the room, and the excitement when the band walks on. That moment is on the top of my mind every day in the workshop. Im always studying other bands to see what they do with that precious moment. The other day a new kind of equipment for stage reveals hit the market. And it fits perfectly into my vision for how to do the Marble Machine X stage reveal on the world tour.



You helped lift this project up on that stage. By being here and supporting me you have not only provided financial means to make this happen. Much more importantly, you have told me that the whole project is an idea that should be pursued. 
From someone who is incredibly lucky to live in a world where a seemingly novel idea can be embraced and supported like this, Thank you!


I will continue to create youtube videos, both from the tour but also other types of content. I have several other new music instrument projects I would love to make happen but in those I will try to take another kind of role, maybe more the role of the inventor who comes up with the idea and letting other teams build the actual instruments. That way I can focus on recording and performing music.

I would love to make more tutorial content, who knows perhaps even daily blogs form the world tour. We will probably visit a lot of interesting maker events and there is always cool things to share from those. 


Thank you for being a part of the process leading up to that moment. I am looking forward to see you there!

Firstly, we would like to thank all of you spooky bitches for loyally listening and joining us on this journey to realising our podcast dreams.

It's thanks to your support that we have both been able to quit our jobs and go full-time on RedHanded! Meaning that we are 100% dedicated to bringing you high-quality, toe-curling, gory goodness every single damn week. 

And we want to make sure that it stays this way, so to ensure that what we put out is worthy of your time we need your help! Could you chuck us a bit of change once a month to help us:
keep the lights on, and the bills paid at RedHanded HQ
find the time to produce extra episodes & work on exciting new bonus content
and most importantly keep RedHanded weekly!

To think, that for as little a month as the cost of your morning cup of coffee you could help make all of this a reality!

But if you can‚Äôt, don‚Äôt worry at all - RedHanded will always be free for you, lovely listener!

However if we do get enough contributions here, the quality and the quantity of RedHanded in your ear will only keep increasing!

Thank you RedHanders,

Cynthia Lin ," music, ukulele lessons, and a positive online uke community (cynthialin)","4,936",,,1973,May 2015,"MY MISSION:

I share ukulele tutorials and arrangements for free on YouTube because I believe that
everyone has the ability to create and make music
through teaching ukulele, i can help more people access their creative abilities
the joy and creative empowerment of making music can change the world for the better 

THE BACKSTORY:

Aloha uke friends!

My romance with the ukulele began about 4 years ago. After 6 years of touring and traveling with my beloved Taylor guitar, I was tired of constantly worrying about grumpy flight attendants and passengers who might inadvertently cram their luggage on top of my instrument. The size of the uke attracted me; the cultural phenomenon that the Uke has become won me over.

While learning to dance hula in Chicago (of all places), I began singing with my kumu (teacher) and fell in love with Hawaiian music, those lush irresistible harmonies and the heart-and-soul storytelling approach. When I left Chicago, my kumu gifted me an ukulele. It would be a few more years until I would play ukulele regularly.

Now I play uke everyday. I teach ukulele classes 3 times a week, perform jazz ukulele gigs a couple times a month, and have written several songs on the uke. My ukulele video tutorials have become more and more popular (thank you!), and I love sharing the joy that comes from simply strumming, singing, and playing the uke.

My growth on the uke has everything to do with my sharing the instrument. I'm taking on the  to push myself to share more, and I've created this Patreon page to give the uke fans and fellow players out there a way to support my teaching and playing. I love the craft of creating special uke arrangements for my favorite songs. With your support, I'll be able to focus more energy on creating arrangements and producing videos and tutorials.

I've posted  because I believe my teaching style can help people grasp the basics of ukulele faster (and thereby spread the joy of ukulele faster!). You may have found me because your romance with the Uke has just begun - I encourage you to share that joy with others. If you'd like to support my teaching and playing, I welcome it, but I intend to continue posting and sharing regardless because it's the best way I can bring more music to the world.

I'll be posting a new video everyday for 100 days, and we'll see what happens beyond. Please keep watching, strumming along, and spreading the word. Follow your passion, and go play uke!"

I‚Äôm most well known for creating GBA4iOS, a Game Boy Advance emulator for iOS. 

Since releasing GBA4iOS in 2014, I‚Äôve been working on its successor, Delta, along with an entirely new platform for downloading apps: AltStore. For most of that time I was going to school at USC and supporting myself as a freelancer, but between work and classes I wasn't able devote as much time as I‚Äôd like to my own apps (as anyone who has followed Delta‚Äôs development knows quite well‚Ä¶). Since graduating in 2018, I was able to use my extra time to finish Delta and have loved every second I‚Äôve spent working on it üòä

....which brings us to today. I feel so lucky to have worked with some amazing companies as a freelancer, but I‚Äôve realized that nothing makes me happier than building apps like Delta that bring people joy, or AltStore which creates an opportunity for apps we've never seen on iOS. My dream would be to do this full time, but alas I also need to keep myself alive (without subjecting anyone to ads), which is where Patreon comes in.

If you enjoy my apps and would like to support me, you‚Äôve come to the right place. There are some great benefits I‚Äôm excited to offer if you choose to contribute, but beyond that it‚Äôs simple: donating buys me time to work on the projects that are fun for us both üéâ.

No matter what, I can't wait to show you everything I have planned. If you'd like to help me finish these apps faster though by supporting me, you really are helping me accomplish my dream, so thank you from the bottom of my heart üíú."

Vivienne Medrano ," ""Hazbin Hotel"" and more Cartoons!! (VivienneMedrano)","4,844",,,2392,Mar 2014,"HEYA INTERNET!  My name is Vivienne Medrano (AKA Vivziepop) and I love making cartoons!!

Ya know that fan made Kesha song with the werewolf? Ya know that funny hell show with tons of red? Yeh those are my fault!

A bit about lil ol‚Äô me -I am a grad of SVA (School of Visual Arts) in NYC, majoring in traditional animation! Now I animate and direct cartoons, films, and music videos based on all the crazy characters I keep coming up with fulltime! I got my start doing fan-animations to songs I love, and I hope to still do those here and there, but have since shifted focus to original content! <3 I adore musicals, villains, and animals!

Nowadays what I'm most passionate about (and extremely thankful to be able to create) is entirely original cartoons, and with YOUR HELP I can keep making even more!!
Have you heard of a little indie cartoon (currently in production) called HAZBIN HOTEL?!
No? Well here is a snazzy trailer for ya!


 As of right Hazbin Hotel is my primary focus I am dedicating most of my efforts and rewards to that project!!

But as it chugs along and starts heading to the finish line I wanted to make sure the cartoon well doesn‚Äôt run dry! So I have been planning future cartoons of ALL KINDS, and how do you see peeks at all the fun new things to come? Pledging to this PATREON!
I have reworked my tier rewards to better reflect what I can comfortably share and actually deliver due to my increasingly demanding workload and trying to keep things as under-wraps as I can! Did you know running and directing a 30 minute cartoon made outside of a studio is hard? ME EITHER!! Coming up with sharable content each month is hard work, but I've figured out ways of doing so!


If you enjoy my past works, be it the ‚ÄúDie Young‚Äù fan-animation or my old webcomic ‚ÄúZoophobia‚Äù I‚Äôm confident you will enjoy Hazbin Hotel! It is a 30 MINUTE LONG animated pilot of a series I have been developing for years!! It is adult in subject matter, but I can promise it has a great deal of heart and thought put into it! The project will be in my style and will be as fluidly 2D animated as possible, it will include multiple songs and is nearing it‚Äôs final stages of production! A LOT is still left to do, but we are reaching the finish line and will be likely dropping a release date soon!! Thanks to all the amazing support of the project so far, both here and via merchandise sales, I have been able to raise the rates of all the team members to the point they are being paid much more sturdy fair animation rates for the quality of work they are doing, which is ensuring they can continue working on not only Hazbin but FUTURE cartoons as well, and I can‚Äôt thank everyone enough for enabling that!
Paying people fair rates for amazing work is key, and I‚Äôm so thankful I can pay the amazing talents helping me bring this beast to life what they deserve and more! <3






you get to help support me and earn my appreciation and a big ol‚Äô THANK YOU!! <3!
You also get to see anything I post publicly anywhere!

A ton of reasons, right now independent projects are my focus, Hazbin is still in deep production and I'm developing more cartoons to add to the pipeline! Patreon funding helps me to create quality 2D animated projects without having to rely on a studio or greenlight! Thanks to this Patreon I can self fund tons of new cartoons, that will have zero studio restriction or meddling for pilots, and allow me to tell things that really come from the passion of not only me, but the artists, writers, and actors who help bring it to life! My dream is to expand my channel and the cartoons on it, and show the world what can be accomplished by driven creators and artists!
I have a number of films and even series in the pipeline and Patreon funds help with-




I have a large team of animators, colorists, and voice actors! You're not just supporting me, you're supporting over a dozen other artists working hard to bring passion projects to life!


Oh lemme tellsya -LOTS!
Anyone familiar with my old webcomic ‚ÄúZoophobia‚Äù will be thrilled to know I‚Äôm currently scripting two shorts relating to the comic's characters, and hopefully at least one of them will be the next SHORT cartoon in the pipleline. I have always loved things like ‚ÄúOh Yeah cartoons‚Äù that just have a ton of varied cartoons of all kinds in one place, and I‚Äôd love to try to get as many fun ideas out of my mind as possible. So I plan on producing a number of shorter form cartoons (3-5 minutes) for everyone to enjoy! Alongside a ZP short, we have a super secret demon cartoon (I know, another one), a horror short, and maybe even something Timber related -plus a ton more waiting in the wings!! BASICALLY theres a ton of fun new stuff ready to be brought to life! Maybe even the return of a certain blue werewolf gal....! You can look forward to hearing some exciting voice actors, and collaborations with other talented youtubers hehe!


FEAR NOT DEMON ENTHUSIAST, if you donate now or even after Hazbin pilot production finishes, you will be helping to fund HAZBIN HOTEL COMICS -both published AND free (though even published ones you will get early peeks at as a patron!) You will also be adding to the future budget of the project and any additional funds and surprises down the line as we see what Hazbin‚Äôs future will become!! Whether it lives here on youtube or becomes a full fledged animated series someday- you helped make it possible!
Either way you will be helping to ensure the story doesn‚Äôt stop and you can see more of the shenanigans these characters get up too!
Trust me, they have just gotten started‚Ä¶.


Simple, Merch is more of a physical reward people want! Some enjoy merch of things they love and that‚Äôs something separate from what Patreon offers as place where I can show peeks are development, or animation. Merch offers an alternate for people who want a lil more direct physical reward or maybe can‚Äôt afford too donate/pledge- they get swag of a project they love! I can promise you that Merch is it‚Äôs own beast that ends up funding plushies/pins/guest artists as well as adding to budget. Patreon is unaffected by merch and merch is unaffected by patreon! Plus sales from merchandise offer an amazing alternative source of revenue to fund projects. Believe it or not animation is EXPENSIVE when you pay people more fair-studio rates, and as the cartoons start getting bigger in scale, so does the price tag. Merch is an extra safety net when Patreon fluctuates, and it is 100% optional! If you already pledge, don‚Äôt feel obligated to buy merchandise as well, but if you want too HELL YEAH! You are makin‚Äô dreams happen fella!
Long story short, if you like something sometimes you just want something physical to show that, and every bit goes back into helping us make these things for free!!


HONESTLY, Freelance is something I‚Äôm aiming to phase out entirely. But as of RIGHT NOW I feel extremely uncomfortable using patreon or merch sales on myself. Trips home, shows, movies, figures, sometimes even RENT (lol maybe I should be ok using it for that bit I DON‚ÄôT) I just prefer the funds I get to go DIRECTLY to projects, since so many can add up fast. So I tend to see commission and freelance funds more as -mine- BUT I plan to start streaming more regularly and if/when I do, I might let any money raised from such things go to my living day to day so I can comfortably cut freelance from my life- FINALLY.
I have been avoiding finding intensive studio work for the sake of having the time for all the projects, the first time I get a studio job it‚Äôll be on one of my own shows babehhhh heeeeeeeeeyyy (hopefully)

I definitely want people supporting me to get something of worth. After being on Patreon a while and seein' what I'm REALLY able to handle, I have revamped my rewards to gear them towards my current work!! I appreciate the donations and so far I have had AMAZINGLY PATIENT, UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTIVE PATRONS! I love you guys, I really do. So far I have felt the stress and struggle of trying to make sure I give everyone what they deserve for their support, but I can‚Äôt thank everyone enough for their coping with how much I‚Äôm balancing and how hard I‚Äôm working to keep things moving! I can't wait to be putting out not only 'Hazbin' but plenty more cartoons for you all to enjoy!"

Seriallos , Raidbots (seriallos),"4,728",,,1360,Jan 2017,"Hi there!  I'm Seri and I love making useful sites/apps for WoW players!

I'm an avid user of SimulationCraft and have built Raidbots to make using it as easy as possible - no downloads, no repetitive item lookups on Wowhead, and no mucking with fiddly scripts.  Beyond the UI, Raidbots runs simulations on powerful hardware, generally more powerful than your own gaming PC, which both limits performance issues on your own machine as well as making the results available faster.

Also Available: Raidbots Premium

You can subscribe directly on the site which provides some additional billing options (pay for several months at once) - create or login your user and go to your account page.

What is Raidbots?

Raidbots attempts to make using SimulationCraft as easy and fast as possible for folks both new to SimulationCraft as well as seasoned veterans.

Many common tasks are handled: optimizing the gear you have, finding the best drops, generate stat weights for your character, compare gear, and compare talents.



Patrons skip the line on the website, can run larger simulations, and can gain additional perks for the Discord bot.



Running the site is very expensive. Patreon lets folks who find the site useful fund it directly to make sure I can keep running the site into the future. Direct funding is way more sustainable than just about anything else. I still run ads for non-patrons to help cover additional costs but make sure to provide an ad-free experience for those that support me directly.



SimulationCraft is an open source program which rapidly simulates ""virtual"" WoW combat. It generates a comprehensive report of damage done, damage taken, ability breakdowns, and more. A lot of theorycrafters use it extensively to determine general stat weights (which stats are best for your character), talent recommendations, best-in-slot lists, and more. However, to really min/max your own character, you often need to use it yourself because of the complexity of gear and item iterations. ""Sim yourself"" has become a common refrain in a lot of class Discords for questions about these things.

SimulationCraft has a pretty active community of developers who are doing the dirty work of building the models and simulations so we can benefit."

Along the way, you'll find plenty of characters, quests, stories, fights, and mysteries to unlock.

There are over 100 H-scenes with unique art (almost all animated) -- with additional in-game variations with many more to come.

Books 1, 2 and 3are finished! Every route and playthrough is a different, unique experience, with lots of choices and H-scenes. Book 2's routes are particularly different from one another and are each packed with their own unique scenes.

Book 2 has roughly 4x the content of Book 1 and lots of complexity, while Book 1 is a more straightforward experience.

Book 3 is where you'll have all sorts of fun with a pint sized earth bender. Once again depending on what route you choose it can get nasty or nice.  New girls like Suki, Joo Dee, Jin etc and an underground maze to slowly explore are some of it's unique elements.

Book 4,   still in development, is where you'll meet a female avatar from the south pole. Whereas the other main girls of book 1, 2 and 3 could only bend one element, this girl has no problems doing anything the other girls could.








Your support is what makes it possible for us to build this game, and build more games like it. We're creating these games because there's not enough of them, and we love them, but we also hope you wouldn't mind tossing a few dollars our way. Our gratitude extends far past the rewards we offer, but we've got some sweet extras that won't take much time away from making the game in the first place!

Starting at $5.00 you will get access to all early game builds and development updates. $10.00 level support gets you large, high-quality, pre-layered images every month, including art that won't be used in-game or found anywhere else. If you're able to help us out even more, the higher levels have some pretty cool stuff like custom art, events, and the ability to playtest for bugs and stuff.

If you can't support us, don't worry, the game will always be released for free.


We've finished book 3 and working on the start of the 4th. We continually seek to prove how serious we are and how much content we have planned. We're pretty tired of how many game makers release tiny teases. We wanted something substantial, and don't be mistaken, this game is substantial. There are hours of content, containing dozens and dozens of naughty scenes with multiple characters, tons of quests, fights, intrigue, you name it.


Sticking to the way of breaking up chapters, each ""Book"" is its own game, in it's own nation. is in the Water Tribe with Katara, is in the Fire Nation with Azula. is in the Earth Kingdom with Toph. There will be at least 4 books. Each book is filled with lots of characters and events, and each has its own unique feel. Book 1 is simple and easygoing... Book 2 is darker, more complex, and larger. And so on.


Each book has two routes -- essentially a ""slave"" route and a ""love"" route. Each route has its own unique story, scenes, events, and interactions. will essentially be 8 full games in one comprehensive storyline when complete.

I make maps for non-specific fantasy settings, so they will easily drop into your homebrew campaigns or slot into pre-constructed campaigns that need a little more content.

Here you will find my battle maps, which are maps for tabletop role-playing games. They're top-down views of fantasy locations for figurines to do battle and otherwise interact with the environment. I hope that my maps will make your dungeon mastering experience smoother and require less setup!

If you need to get in touch, you can email me at Neutral.Party.Art@gmail.com

How does this all work?

Here on Patreon you can pledge or donate to me based on the reward tiers to the right. I offer tiers of $1, $2, and $5 per creation, each offering escalating benefits. You can expect about 3 or 4 maps per month, but in case I churn out more than you expected you can set up a Maximum Monthly Pledge after you select a tier so that you don't end up paying more than you're comfortable with.

You will only be billed when I create new content and you can remove your pledge any time you want without consequences. I hope you will pledge a buck and come along for the ride so I can devote more time to this and create more content!



Many people use my maps digitally on platforms like Roll20, but here's how I recommend using them physically. Download Adobe Reader, a free program for interacting with PDFs, and drop in one of the PDFs that I provide with nearly every maps' files. Click the printer button and select 'Poster' from the Page Sizing & Handling section. This setting will print the map to scale over several sheets of whatever size paper you're using, and once it's printed you can assemble the map by taping the sheets together. Be warned that, due to the size of my maps, this may cause it to print on up to 12 sheets of paper and it will use quite a lot of ink as well. 

There are many different ways to print your maps depending on your printer, but this should work for just about everyone. Send me a message if you have any problems!"

We're the hosts of Watch What Crappens, a podcast about all the crap on Bravo we love to watch.

We love podcasting, and we love you, and we love money.  Specifically, in reverse order. Thank you for making our podcast the huge success that it is.  We hope to get bigger and better, and that's where this page comes into play.  As we grow, we need your help.  We have no plans to turn this into a premium podcast and charge for our content.  We will continue to do weekly shows for the same price as usual: free!  But we do have plans to shamelessly ask for donations.  Don't worry though: we're not just going to sit here with a tin cup.  You're going to get something out of this too.

With Patreon, you you can pledge $1 per episode, $5 per episode or whatever else your generous little heart can part with (ie. $1,000 per episode).  You can also become a premium or super premium sponsor. In return, you'll get weekly bonus episodes ($1 level), Crappens on Demand video recaps ($5 level) or shoutouts ($50 and $85 levels). 

Oh, and don't worry:  you can set a cap to how much you want to donate per month; so if we go crazy and post 100 episodes for some reason, you won't be screwed. 

Thanks everyone!

Thank you for visiting my Patreon page. I create print-ready miniatures for table top role-playing games and then release them for free each month.

Why Paper Miniatures?

I love table-top role playing games, but gathering up all of the materials you need to play can be a pretty daunting task, so I just wanted to make that part a bit easier for people and create some fun art in the process :)

Your Support
I'll continue to create and release print & play miniatures throughout each month on my own, but with your support I'll be able to afford to spend even more time doing so - my dream is to be able to work on Printable Heroes full time, creating even more minis, maps, dungeon tiles, full adventures, and other awesome role playing resources.

Rewards
By becoming a Patron you can gain access to bonus material: back view art for the minis, art and color variations, cutfiles, vote on what I create next, and other neat perks each month. 


If you're new and want to see what Printable Heroes is all about I recommend checking out my new releases here:



It's still under construction so not all of the files have been updated/added, but PrintableHeroes now has a Website Catalog to make it easier to locate and download files.  You can access it here:



If you're already a patron then please make sure to log in under the My Account tab at the top to be able to access files.

Dynamic Dungeons , animated maps for tabletop RPG and miniature games (dynamicdungeons),"4,143","$17,406 per map pack",$4.20 per map pack,1020,Dec 2017,"Thank you for visiting this page.
My dream was to bring gaming maps to life since I first used my TV as a gaming table in a Dungeons and Dragons adventure. 

Animated maps? 

Me and my friends really enjoy playing these ""living maps"", thanks to which the water flows, the fog wreaths, and the flickering flames of the campfire illuminate the swaying trees of the forest in our encounter scenes.

Each one of my maps is a looping HD/UHD video (and still images for online platforms), a carefully designed action scene not to affect the story of a roleplaying game. In addition to the wonderful live fantasy environment, each motion map features well-composed ambient sounds, creating a perfect atmosphere for you to take your imagination to the next level.

I'm not just creating looping video files in grid and gridless versions but high quality still images of each map for virtual tabletop platforms. By becoming a Chaotic Good patron, you'll immediately get access to more than 200 animated maps and the static versions. If you support at least 3 creations in a month you'll receive additional, exclusive maps.

Check out my 





I'll continue creating and releasing 2-3 animated map packs (including statics) monthly, a , an or a  encounter scene,  rooms, chambers, and corridors, even free fan content for popular, official WOTC modules. Thanks to the support of my generous patrons, now I work on Dynamic Dungeons full time, creating at least three motion map packs every month.



If you click ""become a patron"", you immediately get access to all previous rewards for free and be able to choose a donation tier for the future releases. I currently have tiers ranging from all the way up to , most of which have rewards like HD and UHD video files and high quality still images. You can cancel or adjust your patronage at any time.
The number of map packs I publish in the month determines how much you contribute.  
For example, if you pledge $3 per map pack and that month I publish 3 rewards, you'll contribute $9 for that month. If I fail to release maps, you will not be billed. 
An example: In 2018 February I released 3 rewards. Even if the rewards (packs) contained more maps, like night versions, or alternate versions, patrons were charged only once per reward. 
I released the 'Dungeon of Skulls' which contained 5 maps + 5 others with torches for Chaotic Good patrons but all of it was released as one reward (in several posts), only $5 was charged total for this theme, not for every single map in this package. (Usually, a reward comes in four posts, but it doesn't mean you'd be charged more times.)
Then I released the village also for $5 even if it contained the night versions and the day and night version of the outer walls.
The last reward of the month was the airship (day and night versions, with a ballon and magical propulsion) and the maps in this reward also cost 5$ total.
I also posted free giveaways, so a chaotic good patron in that month was charged only $15 for more than 16 maps. During the first year, I released several modular dungeon packs, sometimes more than 10 maps in each pack for the price of one reward, so a Chaotic Good Patron was charged for $15 and received more than 25 map variations. Check out the rewards from the beginning in the  . 


If you're concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you're entering your payment info. That way there are no surprises at the end of the month. Patrons who support every or at least 3 creations in the month get extra maps and special rewards.
For example, you can pledge $5 per release and get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 2 releases that month, but in this case, you won't get some exclusive maps. 
A large part of the money donated to this Patreon goes to supporting this project. (I'll buy new 3d models and plugins to bring you better and better content)









If you become a Patron you help bring the Dynamic Dungeons Modular Editor and Player App to life, which is a unique modular dungeon building system. A demo version is available now fro free.  Also, several modular packs were already released, different themes will come soon.



My name is Tamas, a 3D designer, musician and dungeon master, father of two.
Thank you for noticing and paying attention to my Patreon page! I hope you are inspired by my work and you'll have a lot of good time roleplaying!

Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector.


The gridded HD maps are optimized for a 40‚Äù Tv, where the size of the squares are exactly 1‚Äù. The 4k maps are optimized for a 50‚ÄùTV.
If you have a smaller or larger screen, I suggest playing the gridless versions of the maps with the  where you can set custom hexa and quad grid overlay.


Although both solutions are possible, TVs are more widespread and it‚Äôs what I would recommend as well. Let‚Äôs look at the pros and cons of the various forms of display:







A 40‚Äù full HD resolution LCD device is a perfect choice. If you are planning to buy a TV for gaming purposes, I recommend choosing a device with HDMI ports on the side and not the back. Avoid using TVs with an installed glass surface significantly distanced from the screen surface. (This was typical of older models. Due to the distance between the glass surface and the screen, you might experience a floating effect when viewing the figures placed on the screen from the side)
A 30‚Äù screen is fine, yet it will result in a smaller play surface, and you should consider buying the Dynamic Dungeons Player to apply 1"" grid on the video maps.  


You can use plasma, LCD or Led Tv (which is basically an LCD screen, but with LED backlighting), but which type TV it is doesn‚Äôt really matter for this predicament, as no flat screen is filled with floating gasses or millions of drops of anti-gravity techno-color liquids :). Nothing is going to settle at the bottom of your screen no matter how many years it stands on your table or hangs on your wall.
No, it‚Äôs not going to harm your TV internally to lay it down.
Special ventilation is only suggested if you have a built-in tv enclosed in the table.





All media players are suitable, yet I recommend using Quicktime on Mac and Movies & TV app works nicely on Windows. The  can loop the videos smoothly. Additionally, it offers the advantage of playing videos with quad and hex grids, fog of war settings, tokens, and particle effects.


Yes, I'm happy to see my maps in action. Please mention or give credit in the description to Dynamic Dungeons. The preferred citation is the URL to my Patreon page, which is: 



As I usually add three rewards per month, it will cost you 15 dollars a month to be a chaotic good patron. If you feel that‚Äôs too much, you can set a limit, e.g. a 10 dollar cap for your support, but in this case you'll miss some of the extra scenes. Patrons who support every or at least 3 creations in the month get extra maps and special rewards. You can delete your support at any time. Read more about it  .


My maps are only available through Patreon for the time being, yet the older maps will soon be available separately and in thematic packs. Chaotic good level supporters can make purchases through the webshop (coming soon) at a 50% discount.


Yes, here‚Äôs the list: 


Yes, you will have free, instant access to all (more than 100) previously released maps, which you can download without making any additional payments. When joining, you can choose a donation tier for future releases.


A reward consists of more than a single map and instead involves at least two or even more designs. New releases contain a plain version in the style of the motion maps. I make a number of map variations so the scenes could be used in multiple ways. I will strive to provide an increasing amount of content for future rewards. 


Yes, I‚Äôm happy to hear your suggestions and I‚Äôll do my best to satisfy the requests that inspire me, yet Patreon is fundamentally a platform of support that puts a great deal of emphasis on creative freedom.


That depends on how much time I have left in the month apart from the works through Patreon. Should you have any questions, get in touch through the address."

The business model of creating content and giving it away for free is not a particularly great one.

There is another way though, and that's support from our readers and listeners. If you enjoy what we do, and you'd like access to even more exclusive podcasts, articles, YouTube live streams, Discord chat, our Fantasy Football league, and more, then sign up as an Arseblog member.

We don't do clickbait, we don't do pop-ups, pop-unders, auto-playing videos or 17 things you learned about that thing you never needed to learn anything about anyway.

What we do is create great quality writing and podcasts. We have a team of people who enjoy writing and talking about the team they love. And if you get on board, we'll love you too. I mean, we love you anyway, but we'd love you just a little bit more.

Everything that we do already on Arseblog and Arseblog News remains free, the same as it always has been, but if you sign up to become an Arseblog member on Patreon you get extra with podcasts and writing that won't be available anywhere else but here. There's also an exclusive monthly email, advance notice of tickets for live podcasts and events, and other things too.

Sampson Boat Co ," a rebuild of the historic 1910 wooden sailing yacht, TALLY HO (sampsonboatco)","3,943",,,1024,Dec 2017,"Hi! My name is Leo and I am an English Boatbuilder on a mission to rebuild and relaunch a historic wooden sailing vessel that was built in 1910, called TALLY HO.

Firstly, many thanks for showing an interest and dropping by. This project is the biggest thing I have ever undertaken, and it's both labour-intensive and expensive. I am experienced, hardworking and dedicated, but I would struggle to finish this project without the support of people like yourself. 

When I considered taking on TALLY HO to save her from being destroyed, I knew the amount of work and expense would be extraordinary. As I thought about ways to tackle it, I developed the idea of documenting the rebuild, and involving volunteers. I hoped this would not only help make the restoration possible, but also turn it into a wider-reaching project that will be of interest and benefit to a range of boatbuilding and sailing enthusiasts, and also introduce others to the craft and the way of life that has bought me so much satisfaction.

I hope to restore TALLY HO with as much historical accuracy as possible, whilst maintaining the highest standards of materials and workmanship, so that she will last for at least another 107 years. Eventually I plan to sail the boat back from the Pacific NW to the UK, which will be a journey worth documenting in itself, and race her in the famous Fastnet Race, which she won in 1927.



Although I have been saving money as hard as I can for the last few years, this project is proving to be a lot more expensive than I had imagined. My plan was originally to return to paid work whenever neccessary to top up the funds, and I am still perfectly willing to do so if I need to. However, the financial support I have been receiving from my amazing supporters on Patreon has helped me minimise those interruptions. 

Thanks for reading, and a massive thank-you to all those who have supported my project so far, financially or otherwise.

Wait But Why , high-quality blog posts (waitbutwhy),"3,892",,,1936,Jun 2015,"Here's our situation. Back in 2013, my kindergarten bff and long-time business partner, Andrew Finn, and I were running a test prep company we had started five years earlier. We're the excitable types, and whenever we come up with an idea for a new creation, we try to figure out if there's a way to make it happen. I'd been lamenting to Andrew how badly I was itching to do one of my creative side-projects full time. He knew how much the side projects meant to me and had always been a big supporter of them. The shame was that they weren't things we could do as a team. At some point in this conversation, the light bulb flickered on and we decided to start a new blog. And Wait But Why was born.

In the first few months, a couple things happened.

First, people discovered the site and a sizable readership developed. This was incredibly exciting.

Second, we learned that running a blog is annoyingly expensive. There's the hosting and the site maintenance and the money Facebook started charging us to reach a large portion our followers and the Mailchimp fees and the food and apartment and clothes I need to not die. The tricky thing is that around the same time, Andrew and I were both introduced to a new character: Tim the Wait But Why Nazi. TWBWN turned out to be very particular about every single thing that appeared on the site. He despised banner ads, hated the concept of marketing things to our email subscribers, didn't want to create ""premium content,"" and didn't want to raise money from investors. TWBWN seemed intent on making Wait But Why the least profitable business venture of all time.

So Wait But Why was a hit with readers and also a money-flushing toilet. Something had to give.

Then we discovered Patreon. At first we felt super icky and weird about asking readers to support the blog, but the more we thought about it, the more sense it made. If even a small portion of our readers had a desire to support the site, we might be able to have our WBWN cake and eat our non-money-flushing cake too. We gave it a try.

It turns out a lot of our readers were more than happy to support Wait But Why. Within a couple months, Patreon had solved most of our problems. The site was breaking even, and our runway, for the first time, looked long.

When our Patreon support reached the next level, we made our first hire: Alicia, whose official title is Wait But Why's ""Manager of Lots of Things."" Alicia has been so good at her weird-ass motley crew of a job that Andrew and I can't imagine how anything ever happened at the company before she was here.

Today, Wait But Why is an unpredictable operation. First there were short weekly posts. Then there were longer, more sporadic posts. Most recently was a post that took me three years and is currently being released as a long post series. We're planning on starting a podcast when the series is done (we've already recorded a few episodes), along with getting back to short, regular posts. We have an app in the works. In 2017 we threw a big one-day in-person event for our readers, called Wait But Hi, that took place in 168 countries, and we have another in-person event in our plans. There's a lot of random shit happening over here, and it's all supported by Patreon.

When you're a Wait But Why supporter, you're not really sure what you‚Äôll be supporting‚Äîall we can tell you is that you're supporting me and Alicia working full-time on things we think you'll like (along with the general costs of the site). We can't tell you for sure exactly what those things will be, but we can promise we'll always be putting our all into it.

More than anything, Patreon maximizes our ability to make an impact. It's why we can put everything out for free and reach anyone with an internet connection. It's the quiet little engine that powers the Wait But Why universe.

We don't do official ""rewards"" for patrons, but patrons usually get a sneak peek at what we're working on, and during 2019 I started a random monthly vlog exclusive to patrons. We plan to stay in touch monthly in 2020. We also treat patrons kind of like our company board‚Äîif there's a big decision to make, we know we can always email patrons for advice.

I'd also like to note that those who decide to support us should never feel weird about ending their support at some later point. We know how tight a life budget can be, and being a supporter for any amount of time is a great help.

Anyway, thanks for reading, and a huge thanks to our supporters for enabling Wait But Why to become what it is today.

TwoSeven ," a website to watch videos together (Netflix, Amazon, HBO, etc) (twoseven)","3,650",,,589,Feb 2019,"Guru and Namita have been together for about 12 years now. Through the years, they've lived in different cities..and countries, even! Somewhere down the line, they even got married to one another. They've always loved watching movies and TV shows together, but couldn't do so often due to distance. Initially, they resorted to what a lot of people do - a countdown on a Skype call to play/pause videos at each end. However, as computer scientists, they knew they could do better. This culminated in TwoSeven, which they believe will help make long-distance a little less painful for other couples, families, and friends.

TwoSeven (twoseven.xyz) combines video sync with webcam and text chat, making it the next best thing to being together while watching. Currently, you can watch videos from
YouTube
Netflix
Hulu
Disney+
Crunchyroll
HBO
Amazon
With the TwoSeven browser extension, you can watch videos from a vast majority of other websites as well.

Although things have changed, and they now live together, their passion for TwoSeven persists. Their goal is to make TwoSeven the destination for anyone wanting to feel togetherness with their loved ones irrespective of distance. Be it school pals reliving their movie nights after heading off to college, new parents sharing a video of their child‚Äôs first steps with family, like-minded buddies watching tutorials and learning together, or just BFFs binge-watching another season of Game of Thrones (or Keeping Up with the Kardashians...no one's judging!).

In the last six months, TwoSeven's user base has grown 1300%! While we're ecstatic about this growth, meeting all the lovely new people in our community, and learning about different ways in which they use TwoSeven, it has also meant higher server costs. If you appreciate our cause of bringing people closer, please support us, and help maintain and improve TwoSeven."

I have been a Pokemon fanatic since the first Pokemon game came out in the United States in 1998. Ever since then, I have been on a quest to catch them all and be the best Pokemon Master! I have played every generation of Pokemon game & continually look forward to new Pokemon game releases.  I love to grow my Pokemon collection for the Trading Card Game, plushie toys, figurines, posters, keychains, game cartridges, & more. I started playing Pokemon GO on 7/7/2016, and have not put it down since. I love photography, and I love Pokemon; so that was when I decided to combine my two passions! You will see on my Instagram page, that as soon as I began Pokemon GO, I started taking AR photographs and uploading them there to share with the world. At the time that Pokemon GO came out, I was still in school earning my Bachelor's degree in Psychology with a minor in Cognitive Neuroscience at Temple University. I worked hard, and finally just graduated from Temple University this August 2017 with a 3.5 GPA. Around the time that Pokemon GO Fest was announced, I realized that there were so many Pokemon fans that I still wanted to show my AR photography to, so I decided to start a YouTube channel on June 28th, 2017 to bring people together. Shortly after that, raid battles were announced, and raids quickly became another favorite activity of mine for Pokemon GO. Covering Pokemon GO with my YouTube channel has turned into my #1 passion, blending my love of photography, psychology, people, and Pokemon in one.

Please help me continue on my quest to be the best like no one ever was; I would love to have you be part of our adventure!!"

Everyday Astronaut ," educational, inspirational and fun spaceflight content (EverydayAstronaut)","3,624",,,1426,Nov 2016,"Rocket science. A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. And rightfully so. I mean just look at a rocket engine! Stare at it too long and your brain might melt. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.

And yet rockets were designed and virtually perfected in an era when computers were the size of a room, and most calculations were done with paper, pencil and a slide rule.

My name‚Äôs Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heals in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited.

But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree‚Ä¶ I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can.

But this isn‚Äôt just some basic surface level information we deal with here. We dive in deep, get into all of the nitty gritty details that engineers spend years going over. I‚Äôll take you behind the scenes of the most exciting missions, get up close and personal with the coolest hardware, talk to the smartest people I can find, and break down incredibly complex topics, because quite honestly, it‚Äôs a lot of fun.

We‚Äôre living in exciting times where the pace of innovation is faster than we‚Äôve ever seen. Where the cost of spaceflight is coming down by orders of magnitude. Where the people living today will explore new worlds amongst the stars.

The point is, rocket science is awesome, and you don‚Äôt need to be a rocket scientist to be excited.

By supporting Everyday Astronaut, you're helping with the immense investment in time, money, and energy to continue this passion project. Tim said he'll stop Everyday Astronaut when he runs out of ideas, time or money. Well the ideas and time are abundant and you're helping add that third key to continuing!  

With each video taking anywhere from 10s to 100s of hours to research, write, shoot, animate and edit, the investment is beyond that of a full time job. The hope is that you find the resources useful and powerful in the era of misinformation and conspiracies. Together, we can educate everyone in a fun, informative and impactful way.

They say enthusiasm is contagious, and we think by sharing our excitement with the world and providing resources for others to be excited, we can help make everyone understand the importance of space exploration."

I'm pirateaba and I write a web serial that updates every Tuesday and Saturday. I am currently in the process of writing The Wandering Inn, a fantasy story which follows the life of Erin Solstice, a girl who finds herself working as an innkeeper in another world. In a reality governed by video game levels and classes, Erin has to find a way to survive while tending an inn that serves monsters and people alike.

So far, The Wandering Inn has been online for over three years, and is over five million words long. The story is continuing, and Volumes 1-6 are currently free to read while the latest chapter is locked by a password until the next update. Twice a week, I release a new password-protected chapter and make the previous one public to everyone. I tend to write ~20,000 words on average per chapter as of late.

I've found this is the easiest way to support myself while writing. Anyone can read my story, but those who like what I write can donate $5 and read the next chapter early--as well as keep me employed. I'm very grateful to all my amazing readers, and hope I can continue to keep providing you with an entertaining story.

Patrons are charged the instant they pledge, so if you pledge right before the next month, you may be charged twice in quick succession."

Bay 12 Games , Dwarf Fortress and other video games (bay12games),"3,301","$8,203 per month",$2.49 per month,1989,Apr 2015,"What's that up there?
Hi!  We're Tarn and Zach Adams, the brothers behind Bay 12 Games.  Our father was a programmer and thought it would be a good idea to get us ready for the emerging computer-dominated world by teaching us how to write video games when we were still learning to read.  This is the result!  Our favorite games were the roguelikes we downloaded from the bulletin board systems in the 80s and exploration games like Starflight (where we learned the word ""disembark"").  We were fascinated by randomly generated maps and experiences that were different every time, and permanent death that still reverberated into future games through persistent save files.  Our early efforts always included these elements, and they grew into the projects we began releasing on the internet in 2000.

Our best-known game is Dwarf Fortress, which we've been working on since 2002.  It was first released in 2006 and we've been improving it ever since.  Known for its depth, the complexity of its mechanics and the stories told by those who played it, Dwarf Fortress was one of the first video games acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  The game's text graphics certainly aren't flashy by today's (or yesterday's) standards, but they allow us to add more content than we'd otherwise be able to manage.  You can see our current development plan .  The game is free and you can try it right now!

Bay 12 Games has been our full-time job since 2007, and we've only been able to do it because of the generous support of our fans.  Making games means a lot to us -- Tarn gave up his job as a math professor to devote all of his energy to Dwarf Fortress, and contributions from our players are now our sole source of income.

It's great to be able to release games that everybody can try out free of charge.  Help us continue to bring more fun to everybody!

As a token of our thanks for your support, Zach will write up a little story for you.  You can see some on the DF Wiki.  We can also mail you a crayon drawing of something dwarfy.  You can scroll down our . Anybody that contributes can also have their name put on the list of ."

Since 2010, For Harriet has been committed to elevating the voices of Black women through storytelling and journalism. We're one of painfully few digital media companies completely owned and operated by Black women, and we've managed to survive this long because of the generosities of supporters and sponsors. 

Where will my money go?
We're proud to pay Black women to share narratives that are overlooked elsewhere, and our patrons help us do that. The goal is always to elevate the work. We want to do things bigger and better, longer stories with more reporting and more editing. Black women deserve premium journalism. We want to deliver that. 

Your money will go to paying Black women creators. That includes writers, editors, video producers and illustrators. We're not limiting ourselves in scope. There are so many stories to tell and countless ways to tell them. 

It's more difficult than ever to sustain an independent media company in the current climate, but we're not looking to get rich. We simply want to challenge what bell hooks calls white supremacist capitalist patriarchy with the brilliance of Black women's voices.

Seanan McGuire , Fiction (seananmcguire),"3,222","$13,250 per Short Stories",$4.11 per Short Stories,1636,Apr 2016,"I'm Seanan McGuire, John W. Campbell Award winner, New York Times Bestseller, and owner of ridiculously oversized cats (seriously, they're the size of corgis). I release an average of five books per year, and have since 2009, including the October Daye series, the InCryptid series, and more, all under my own name. As Mira Grant, I am the author of the Newsflesh and Parasitology series, mixing fringe science with hard science fiction. I don't sleep very much.

It is entirely possible to spend a year's book budget on me already, especially if you're someone who wants to collect all the anthologies and essay collections that I am a part of. I realize and fully understand this, because hoo, boy, I'm not sure I'd be able to keep up with me if I weren't me.  Which is part of why I haven't set up a Patreon before now.


Up until very recently, I lived in a crumbling farmhouse in Northern California with my mother, sister, housemate, and the aforementioned gigantic cats. We purchased the house in 1998, before the real estate boom. Sadly, it was not in particularly good shape then, and wasn't in particularly good shape when circumstances aligned to shift me up the coast toward Seattle.

Moving is expensive, and in this case, it was not a wholly expected expense. Also, well. I had been living with my housemate for twenty years, between the apartment we were in before the house and the house itself, and it's a little surprising how many things I don't own. This is essentially a divorce, after all: somebody gets the cat and somebody gets the couch. (We were not romantically involved, but a twenty year co-habitation is a common law marriage in many states.) Since I was not going to give up my cats, I am down a lot of couches.

So many couches.

And thus...


This is a Patreon with a purpose: to buy me a new toaster, where ""toaster"" is a way of saying ""thing I need for the house."" (Amusingly, an actual toaster is on the list of things I need to get.) Some months, the toaster will be painting a room or buying a bookshelf, or a scanner, or a new desk that actually gives me room to work. Other months, the toaster will be that actual toaster I mentioned.

Because this is a Patreon with a purpose, I'm not planning to keep it running forever. The current intent is one year from start to finish: twelve toasters, whatever shape those toasters may assume. Each month, I intend to post a short video or blog article to introduce the newest toaster, because it appeals to my sense of whimsy. I understand that Patreon doesn't come with accountability, and I don't feel like I need to provide toaster receipts or anything like that, but this is how I can get myself to do this thing.

And I need to do this thing. I really, really need to do this thing. Did I mention that moving is expensive?


Fiction.

Patreon means patronage, in the old, ""I pay people to create for me"" sense of the word. So what you are going to get from supporting this Patreon is exactly what it says on the tin. You're going to get fiction. Most of it will be virtual, delivered electronically. If you back at the higher levels, some of it will be physical. (I have kept these levels extremely limited, because fulfillment is not one of my great strengths, and I need to be able to actually write the things I'm promising. Also, the point here is to buy toasters, not to spend all my toaster money on mailing things around the world. That gets spendy fast.)

By supporting this Patreon, you will be effectively doing what my ad hoc tip jar has done for the last several years: you will be allowing me to prioritize stories that otherwise might not have been able to rise to the top of the priority list. Unlike the tip jar, however, there is not a pre-existing list of which stories will be prioritized: supporters of the Patreon will be able to have a say on what I work on. Which is not something I usually do, so that's exciting!

Backers will receive digital copies of all of the work made possible by this Patreon, plus additional ‚Äúper Thing‚Äù rewards at various backer and milestone levels. There's a possibility that some of those short stories will reappear elsewhere, either sold to magazines or anthologies as reprints, or (in the case of things set in one of my ongoing universes) as free downloads on my website. But the backers of this Patreon will get to read and enjoy them long before anyone else.

I'm hoping to produce one thing a month for the length of the Toaster Project, giving you twelve new stories of varying lengths and giving me a little breathing room as I fight my way through this huge and unexpected expense.

I've met me. Many of these stories will happen anyway. But you can make them happen sooner, and you can help me make a house a home by giving me the ability to buy a toaster."
Ian Hubert , Films and Tutorials and just a Bunch of Stuff (IanHubert),"3,216",,,221,Feb 2020,"Hello! I‚Äôm Ian Hubert!
I‚Äôm a filmmaker and VFX artist- have been for a long time! I‚Äôve done visual effects on a bunch of music videos, and was VFX supervisor on 2018‚Äôs Prospect. I‚Äôve also made lots of weird films and webseries (Including Project Lodon (2014), Tears of Steel (2012), and Dynamo (2012-present).But anyone who‚Äôs followed me at all knows I tend to post a bunch real quick, then disappear for months at a time- that‚Äôs because sometimes you gotta make money! This is my attempt to not have to disappear quite as much...

What do I do?
Lots of stuff!



Hey yeah! For the past year I‚Äôve been making ‚Äú‚Äù, which are one minute tutorials for Blender that try to teach folks some of the CG cheats I‚Äôve learned over the years, and hopefully encourage people to realize, ‚Äúhey! I could do that!‚Äù But I‚Äôm really excited to do more than that. Blender can do so much, and I want to get started making a series breaking down how to go from a sheet of greenscreen in your garage to creating your own immersive world, implementing motion tracking, 3d modeling, lighting, and compositing, all using free software, and all without things getting too complicated, so the creativity gets to stay at the forefront. I mostly just want to see what you crazy people can make!



I also have a couple decades of experience constructing cheap-yet-effective sets and props, and I‚Äôd love to pass what I‚Äôve learned along. 

I have a bunch of passion projects. My biggest is probably



It‚Äôs a webseries I started with my friend Scott Hampson back in 2011 (in a world I started developing in, ack- 2007??). It turns out that episodes take a lot longer to make than I thought, but also maybe not as long as it might look from the outside, because I‚Äôm sitting on literal hours of near-finished stuff. Thousands and thousands of man-hours of work just rotting on a hard drive. It drives me a little nuts not finishing stuff (even if some of it‚Äôs a bit old at this point), so at the very least I‚Äôd love to get these out there. If you feel like taking a little journey into the past, you can . One of the ways I‚Äôm trying to wrap things up is by sliding a bunch of the plot points into a sort of parallel show:



Dynamo Dream! I‚Äôm really excited about this. I guess you could call it a reboot? More a parallel story. It‚Äôs designed to be way easier to film (turns out a lot of folks I knew back in 2012 live in other cities now), and I‚Äôm really excited about the narrative! We‚Äôve already got about an hour of this nearly ready to go (at the last second I decided to create a ridiculously CG heavy opening episode that‚Äôs gumming up the works. It‚Äôs one of my favorite things I‚Äôve ever made, but also took a solid 16 months or so). And while we can do most of the visual stuff ourselves, I know near diddly-squat about audio, so I have to save up a bit of money so I can hire the in Seattle to make it all sound the best it possibly could.



A few years ago I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life- stay in Seattle, or move to LA (or some place slightly more film-centric). I decided to try to do the best I could here in Seattle, and I was able to buy an old church compound on the Kitsap Peninsula in Puget Sound.
It‚Äôs been excellent!! We‚Äôre gradually turning it into a little hub of creativity and cozy living. Part home, part film studio, concert venue, film set, maker space, and art gallery. I‚Äôm living here with my partner Kaitlin Romig (a talented artist photographer, fine artist, and art director!), and Sean Farbolin (the ‚ÄúMaker on the Move‚Äù, who‚Äôs building all sorts of things in the house across the yard).





I‚Äôm glad you asked! Obviously you‚Äôll get more finished content from me, but also!



Oh man. You guys. I make (and have made) a ton of random assets, and I'd love to start uploading them here for you to use in your projects. Greebly bits, digital characters, robots, vehicles, environments, fake posters, logos, stickers, and brands. Project files, motion capture data, stock footage of smoke and crowds and water, all released for anything you want. Whatever I can put up here, I will.






For every tutorial I post, there are usually several private ones I make for individual people, or little tips and tricks that, while fun or useful, don't necessarily need to be blasted out to a hundred thousand+ people on YouTube. I'd love to post those here.
Likewise, I'll go through and break down particularly complicated shots I've worked on to show how they work- and I already have a few scenes I've screencaptured that I want to upload with a voice over explaining my workflow for anyone who‚Äôs curious.



If the filmmaking side‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into, that‚Äôs great! I make most of this stuff in a relative vacuum, and I‚Äôve got so many bits I‚Äôd love to share with an interested group. Crazy deleted scenes, sketches, failed concepts- just bunches of stuff.



Pointing a camera at my face and talking about stuff. Occasionally I‚Äôll do it. Status updates and thoughts and the like! Do I have thoughts?  



Look! I make music! Some people like it! I don‚Äôt really it , but I‚Äôll be posting it here. Because I just have this wild feeling like‚Ä¶ like I can trust you, you know?

You'll get access to a discord channel! Come hang out, or ask questions or whatever! 

This place is going to be my catch-all for anything I‚Äôm making or thinking that I don‚Äôt think needs to be Broadcast To Everyone (which is most of what I make).
Thanks very much for your time, and hopefully see you on the other side!"

This Patreon exists for that purpose--  to make quality furry porn comics again! If you'd like to see new comics with characters old and new, this is where you can help make it happen.

If you don't know what Patreon is, here's the gist of it: You choose a tier that fits your budget. The maximum tier gets you all the content on offer, while the lowest tier gets you a portion of it. Whichever tier you choose, it helps keep the lights on and the furry smut comin'.

Most if not all of my content will be of a pornographic nature, made for adults age 18 and up. I'm aiming to make a minimum of three comic pages a month, with themes ranging from gay, straight, bi, and some weird stuff inbetween. Comics will be uploaded here first for patrons to enjoy, and then made available to purchase for non-patrons once they have concluded. This page is also where you'll be able to view sketches and finished illustrations before anywhere else. Illustrations will be uploaded here as I finish them, and to my other galleries a month after completion. 

I've also provided links to my completed comics below.

(bigclive),"3,182",,,1815,Oct 2015,"If you enjoy my technical videos, then this is an opportunity to show your appreciation by buying me coffee and cookies (I like cookies)  One of the most important things about Patreon is that it gives me an independent communication channel from YouTube so that if things go wrong or I'm VERY naughty and YouTube pull the plug on my channel then we can still stay in touch and you still get to see my videos on a different platform.
Since the great Adpocalypse of 2017 the YouTube advertising algorithm has not favoured ""dangerous"" technical and scientific channels and has given priority to trendy vloggers and fashionistas.  For the technical and scientific creators Patreon offers greater independence from YouTube, allowing us to make more interesting videos without fear of being punished.

My videos will always be available to view free.  I've no intention of ever putting them behind any form of pay-wall and specifically only allow YouTube to put adverts at the start of my videos, because mid-video adverts are just plain annoying.

All Patreons get early access to my videos as I make them, and sometimes encourage me to re-record specific videos with improvements.  This also lets you grab particularly good gadgets on eBay before the rush if I find a particular gadget to be very good.

Please only contribute what you can comfortably afford, and feel free to adjust it down at any time if things get a bit tight.  I've been through the ""living off noodles"" era myself and know that every technical career has its ups and downs.  No matter what you pledge you still get full access.
If you want to be extremely generous because I've helped launch you into a new career or inspired you in darker times then I'm fine with just a few dollars and would rather you used the cash to buy yourself some new test gear or components.  The biggest reward you can give me is to tell me that I helped you."

Hi guys! Welcome to our Patreon page!

We're a team dedicated to creating Visual Novels. We like to create stories that focus on romance, slow build, and character development.

We're currently working on a project called , a first/third-person, choice-based visual novel.





















































You play a session musician who has had a busy lifestyle, having worked in various cities and towns across the country. This has been your life, ever since you graduated from college, where you attained a degree in the field of Music.

Once returning home, you decide to leave the place you grew up in, to start a new life and a fresh start in another town. You have also decided to take a break from the job you know so well, to focus on a brand-new career. You‚Äôre just not sure what that will be yet.

In order to keep the money coming in, you decide to take up a job offer, tutoring Melody, the niece of a woman you meet by chance via an online marketplace. Melody is currently studying music in college, so having an experienced tutor is pretty important for her chosen career path.

You will be spending time with Melody every day. Aside from one-on-one lessons, you will have with her, you will also be accompanying her at various music-related activities. If all goes well, you may even be able to go out on a date with her. And if that goes well too, it could lead to something even better!

You will be making decisions between two or more options, that will negatively or positively affect the outcome of the date and the main story as well. There will be a number of secondary characters and you'll be able to start a romantic relationship with them too.

Will you be that guy that wins Melody's heart and has her singing to her own tune again? Is it possible that you and Melody can make beautiful music together one day?

















That money goes directly into upgrading my equipment and making sure that we have enough time to keep developing these projects on a full-time basis.

TeacupAudio , Audio Roleplays (TeacupAudio),"3,128",,,1578,Jun 2016,"Hey there! I'm TeacupAudio!

I'm a voice actress who specializes in audio role-plays. 

Think of these audios as a guided escape from reality - when you plug in your headphones you immediately become the central character of the story. These stories vary from light and fluffy to heavy and emotional, and somewhere in between some sensual audios too. 

A little bit about my work and the potential for ASMR:

ASMR stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response! Listening to ASMR content can lead to a euphoric experience, such as a tingling sensation on the skin that usually begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. Ultimately, these audios are all about getting the listener to have fun, immerse themselves in the content and unwind from the day.

So, why become a Teacup? Pledges enable me to produce more content, explore new ideas, and invest in better equipment. As such, I can achieve a higher quality of audio and better both the roleplaying and ASMR experience.

I'd really love it if you considered joining our little, loveable community!

Thank you so much. 

All the best,
Teacup x

I have been struggling with many health issues for over 6 years which is what lead me to ASMR. I was in bed one day unable to relax due to all of my pain, when I landed on an ASMR video that brought me some sort of relief/relaxation that I had been struggling to find. That day I decided to start my own channel on Youtube. In the hopes of giving someone else a minute to forget about their anxiety, to ease pain, give someone a friend that they don't have, etc. Being a creator has given me a feeling of purpose that I had been searching to find for so long. It has been the best experience!
Youtube has given me a support system I never had, socialization I haven't been able to have, and a safe space/family when needed. All of which I am forever grateful for! 

I decided to create this Patreon for a tighter community, and to offer another safe space to those who need it. I want this platform to be a chance to further open up about my life, let you all in a little more than I do on Youtube.  Not that I don't love my Youtube family, but it's such a big platform that anyone and everyone can see. This is a safer space where I hope only supporters come, and I feel more safe to open up. 

I hope my content can help you with whatever it is you are needing it to in this moment.
Your support means the world to me ALWAYS! Remember this is YOUR safe space, and you are always loved/welcomed here. 

 XOXO,
 Maddie"

Knitty , a Knitting Magazine (knitty),"3,037",,,1862,Sep 2015,"In 2002, Knitty freaked people out. We published the first issue of our online knitting magazine when there was nothing else like it on the internet. It was completely free, and it didn‚Äôt stink. In fact, it was pretty good and it surprised a lot of people. I created Knitty to collect knitting talent from all over the web and publish it in one professional-looking place where it would be properly edited, showcased and get the recognition it deserved from knitters worldwide.

And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve continued to do, for the last 18 years: seek out and publish amazing knitting patterns, encourage and expose more inspiring work from budding knitwear designers, share great patterns from names you already know and love, and showcase great knitting yarns and products. We have helped launch the careers of some of the most talented people in the handknitting industry. As more and more people have become designers thanks to the ease with which they can publish on Ravelry, we continue to bring the brightest and best to your attention, helping them stand out and get the notice they deserve.

Many of the most legendary internet-instigated knitting patterns and techniques found their audience through our pages: the iconic Clapotis, the mind-blowing sock, the inspiring blanket, and the body parts we love to knit ‚Äì the Womb, the cute and cuddly reproductive organ; and , a functional solution for those who have lost one or both breasts. And so many more...

We are proud of our role in the online knitting world and we want to continue to uphold that mission for the benefit of readers like you, and the designers, patterns and knitting products you‚Äôve yet to see. In order to do that,





. Knitty will still come out every 3 months absolutely free, for as long as we‚Äôre able to produce it. But could you pay? Would you contribute a few dollars an Issue to thank the contributors for their work and to make sure it can continue? For all the enjoyment you've gotten from Knitty over the years? To make sure that you don‚Äôt miss out on the next cowl, shawl, or designed by a ridiculously talented 15-year-old high school student?

What do you get in return? Scroll down past this message to see the different reward levels. I hope there's one that feels right to you. 

Being able to connect with Knitty readers like I'm going to be able to through Patreon has me super-excited to meet you all, and hear what you‚Äôre thinking, working on, dreaming about. Join at the Tangy level and above, and you'll get access to our online forum, the . It's a Patron-only safe space to talk about just about everything.


- we raised the amount we pay our staff and contributors (writers and designers)
- we transformed new Knitty issues into a much more mobile-friendly format
- we reduced all our Ad prices to help small businesses share their wares
- we created the so no small business is left out

And most significantly, this funding has replaced almost all lost advertising revenue, and kept us funded at a functional level.

would really add up. That's just $8 per year. A larger pledge will make an even bigger difference. But if every person who enjoys Knitty puts two dollars or more in our coffee can, that would quickly add up to a lot of dollars over the year. It means a secure future for Knitty and for our readers.

Should our level of funding increase past the current level, we'll be able to hire a designer who will help steer Knitty towards an even more user friendly experience. This has yet to happen...but I am still hopeful the funding will appear when we need it. 

One important thing to know about Patreon (besides how cool it is) is that it's been built with both the artist (that's us) and the Patrons (that's you) in mind. When we release a new Issue, I send out an official New Issue post that says we've made something and released it to our Patrons. You then have to the end of that month to decide if you still want your money to go to Knitty or not. You're not stuck supporting something you don't love. If you leave things be, we'll get your dollars at the beginning of the month following a new release. The surprises are part of the Issue (no extra charge). So you'll only be contributing 4 times per year, no more.

There are other less-Knitty (less friendly, less tasteful, less positive) ways to pay our bills, but this is the one that feels the most right to us. It will change the magazine for the better and allow us to do things we've only dreamed of for years. Knitty was groundbreaking when it launched in September of 2002, completely free. Patreon is similarly groundbreaking and we're excited to be part of this new platform that allows creators and their community to work together to make beautiful things happen.

(If you have about 6 minutes, take a look at what the Knitterati has to say about us.)

Thank you for your support for the past 18 years, and for your help in ensuring Knitty stays strong and vibrant into the future!"

A portion of the money raised goes to support the pod, but given that it isn't very resource-intensive and we've got tons of sponsorship money rolling in from our fake sponsors, most of your Patreon support goes to help fund our educational productions at SciShow, Crash Course, and elsewhere.

The basic question is: If we made you, would you pay for Dear Hank and John? If so, just give us a percentage of whatever you want to pay as a way of thanking us for making you pay. Or not... That is also cool. We understand that not everybody has money to spend, and we would much rather you make sound financial decisions than support our podcast.

I'm Jon, and for the last five years, I've been working on building this incredible community. In that time, we've killed everything in Fallout 3, completed Mass Effect without guns, finished Hitman without killing, and got through New Vegas and all its DLC without healing. Thanks to that, we've already grown past 400,000 subscribers.

When I started the channel in 2013, it was just a hobby for me, while I was also working a full-time job. But thanks to the channel's fantastic growth, I decided to leave my job in September 2015 to work exclusively on this, meaning we're making a lot more videos these days, and hopefully better ones too.

That's incredibly exciting, but not without difficulty - YouTube's ad revenue is unreliable, and the amount it pays has been steadily declining for years, so I'm hoping that Patreon can help make this sustainable for me, so I can continue doing this full-time through 2019 and beyond, and take the channel to some exciting new places, with more videos, more community playdays, and more livestreams.

In return, every Patron gets access to the monthly Patroncast - a behind-the-scenes look at Many A True Nerd, where you can also ask any questions you'd like - as well as sneak peeks at upcoming games, and, most importatly, an occasional photo of Tabby, the Many A True Cat.

Anyway, feel free to have a look at some of our videos, which are, and always will be, freely available on YouTube, and if you feel like this is something you'd like to support, then thank you.

All the best, Jon"

Red lived in a small town in Pennsylvania with her grandmother. The town was known to invite supernatural creatures every year.

Hi, wir sind Stay Forever, also Gunnar Lott und Christian Schmidt, und wir m√∂chten um eure Unterst√ºtzung werben. Wir machen einen Podcast √ºber Retrogames und wir wollen den noch besser, noch regelm√§√üiger, noch umfangreicher, achwas, noch geiler machen. Und daf√ºr bitten wir um eine regelm√§√üige Spende. Ihr wisst schon, rechts auf ""Become a Patron"" klicken. So in etwa:



Was? Stay Forever?

Wir, Gunnar Lott und Christian Schmidt und Fabian K√§ufer, waren mal Spieleredakteure. Dieser Tage betreiben wir neben unseren Brotjobs den Podcast Stay Forever, der eine Art arch√§ologische Expedition in die Geschichte der Videospiele ist. Wir widmen uns in jeder Folge liebevoll und mit Akribie einem alten Spiel oder einer Serie, wir untersuchen, beleuchten, kritisieren und feiern die Titel. Wir machen das schon seit 2011, mit √ºber 100 Folgen und einem Haufen Sonderfolgen. Immer im mal kontroversen, mal harmonischen Gespr√§ch zwischen Gunnar und Chris oder Gunnar und Fabian oder Fabian und Chris. Wir bringen dabei unsere eigenen Erfahrungen, intensive Recherche und unsere besondere Perspektive als Branchen-Berichterstatter ein.





Der ungef√§hr monatliche Podcast bleibt kostenlos und der Kern unseres Schaffens. Mit mehr Geld gibt es mehr Podcasts f√ºr alle, neben Sonderfolgen etwa die neue Serie , finanziert durch die Patrons ‚Äì und nat√ºrlich tolle Podcasts exklusiv f√ºr die Spender, etwa unsere Serie , das ist eine Art, uh, Audio-Let'sPlay (). Oder die in der wir uns eigenen Fr√ºhwerken stellen(immer mit PDF zum Mitbl√§ttern, ). Oder das Koop-Format mit Andr√© Peschke von The Pod (. Oder das Plauderformat FoN () oder andere ‚Äì in der Regel erhalten Unterst√ºtzer 5 Folgen pro Monat, zus√§tzlich zu den ""offenen"" Folgen. Hier ist.

Generell hat sich Stay Forever innerhalb des ersten Jahres mit Patreon-Unterst√ºtzung zu einer veritablen Operation gewandelt: Mit einem festen B√ºro als Hauptquartier, drei Podcastern (Gunnar, Chris und Fabian) und einer Reihe Team-Mitglieder auf Honorarbasis, etwa Lars (Audioschnitt), Fabian (Audioschnitt) und Paul (Grafik). 











Ihr erkl√§rt Euch, wenn Ihr denn m√∂gt, dazu bereit, pro Monat einen von Euch bestimmten Betrag zu spenden. Dieses Einverst√§ndnis k√∂nnt Ihr jederzeit widerrufen, es gibt keine Abo-Fallen oder langfristige Verpflichtungen. Patreon akzeptiert Spenden per Paypal oder Kreditkarte. Wer lieber per Bankeinzug bezahlen m√∂chte, sollte sich bitte unser (identisches) Angebot bei der  anschauen.



Die Sonderfolgen spielen wir √ºber einen passwortgesch√ºtzten RSS-Feed aus, den man easy im Podcatcher oder der Podcast-App von Apple oder sonstwo einbinden kann. Physische Rewards schicken wir per Post, dazu brauchen wir beim Pledge eine Adresse.



Patreon gibt's nicht auf Deutsch. Ist aber alles eigentlich ganz einfach, Patreon ist auf deutsche Kunden eingerichtet. Die geheimnisvolle VAT, die nach dem Pledge noch addiert wird, ist die deutsche Umsatzsteuer, welche die Plattform direkt abf√ºhrt; Dollar werden beim Bezahlen in Euro umgerechnet. Wer also als Unterst√ºtzer 1 Dollar ausgeben will, zahlt ungef√§hr 1,06 Euro (1,00 Dollar plus 19% Steuer mal Umrechnungskurs). Hier noch mal die wichtigsten Begriffe:

: Die monatliche Spende, die man t√§tigt. (Engl. f√ºr )
: Die Belohnungen, die man f√ºr seinen Pledge bekommt. 
: Eine Reihe von Zielen, die wir in der Gesamtsumme gern erreichen w√ºrden, meist verkn√ºpft mit einem Versprechen unsererseits.
: Das englische Wort f√ºr M√§zen, Sponsor, G√∂nner. Ihr, also.
: Die Leute auf Patreon, die (hoffentlich) interessante Dinge erschaffen, Kunstwerke, Videos, Texte oder, √§h, Podcasts. Wir, quasi."

* We basically ask our patrons for help a lot. We run occasional polls to vote on the subject of our next video (our recent ""What Will Happen To Our Artifacts After Legion?"" video was chosen this way), we ask you for ideas on merch design, that sort of thing.

* And keeping our Patrons updated to an annoying degree!  

It's not much, but it's a genuine gesture of our thanks and every bit of it is available to all Patrons. Anyone who wants to give us some of their very own real life money because they enjoy our videos and want to see more is automatically one of the coolest people ever and will be treated as such."

Most of my works are animations requested by patrons or other people and I would like to continue with this.
While I'm constantly trying to improve my skills in animating I also create longer animations when I have the time.

If you read this you usually already should know what kind of animations I create. This patreon campaign is for people who decide to support my work and want me to continue.

The amount of support is something I never thought of but with the help of my patrons I'm able to do this full-time now which is something I really appreciate very much.

What exactly do you get for your support:

Basically more content for everyone. All my work is without watermarks or any other disturbing overlay (if I was not explicitly asked to add one). Also you always have access to the 1080p and 720p renders without the need to pledge any specific amount.

If you decide to pledge you can get some special rewards and participate in surveys to help me choose what animation I will do next.

With the amount of support growing I'll also add new rewards for you.

If there are any questions you can contact me via e-mail: nn55don@gmx.de

Thanks for reading. =)

What is Something Unlimited?

Something Unlimited is a comic-based parody brothel management game. You play as Lex, seeking to concoct a way to rid the world of superheroes while simultaneously placing yourself on one of its thrones. Unfortunately though, plans of world domination tend to cost a lot of money and you‚Äôre practically broke. When Roulette comes to you with the idea for a ‚Äúmeta-bordello‚Äù, you think up the perfect way to supply her with incredibly enticing workers ‚Äì as long as you get a fat cut of the profits, of course.

Will you be able to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù enough heroines, henchwomen and villainesses to work for you? Can you grow the bordello enough to bankroll your final plan for world supremacy? Will you finally be able to take down the heroes/heroines once and for all, as well as your villainous rivals?



The game is mostly feature-complete, with a few minor systems still needing to be reworked. Content additions is the main focus of most updates from now until the game‚Äôs completion.



‚¶Å Wonder Woman
‚¶Å Batgirl
‚¶Å Starfire
‚¶Å Harley Quinn
‚¶Å Poison Ivy
‚¶Å Supergirl
‚¶Å And many more!

Something Unlimited has been in development for quite a while, so there‚Äôs already a ton of content to be discovered that could keep you entertained for hours. (There‚Äôs also a cheat system for those who want to speed through the game too.)



You also never know when a surprise might show up and throw a wrench into your carefully laid plans. You‚Äôre not the only villain with his sights set on world domination after all‚Ä¶

was never intended to be the massive game it is today. When SR7 first began working on the game he thought it would just be a bit bigger than Bend or Break, but development quickly expanded beyond that in an attempt to please SU‚Äôs ever-growing fanbase.

However, SR7‚Äôs talents and interest lie more on the art side of things than the programming side, which is why he made Bend or Break and Something Unlimited with Fungus ‚Äì a Unity asset store visual editor add-on meant to ease the creation of VNs for people who don‚Äôt know code or aren‚Äôt inclined to code their own games.

SR7 has pushed Fungus well beyond what it was ever intended to do and has reached its limits in more ways than one. Each update cycle is bogged down with more development process issues than the last, and that‚Äôs on top of the craziness that just naturally occurs when you spend four years spontaneously expanding the scope of a project well beyond its original intention.

, in order to speed up development and free up SR7‚Äôs time to work on other projects without SU suffering,

However, if you‚Äôre going to do something, you either do it right or not at all. So,, we‚Äôre also making a lot of changes and additions to the game to make it a lot better than ever before ‚Äì an example of which you can see in the video at the beginning of this section.



We didn‚Äôt want to put SU‚Äôs development and content updates on pause during the Rebuild‚Äôs development. It also simply didn‚Äôt make sense to do so because SR7 isn‚Äôt heavily needed for the process since Locke ‚Äì the programmer GG picked up in late 2018 for a side project ‚Äì is heading up the rebuild and coding it from scratch.



Right now, the current intention is to transition over to SU: Rebuilt once it‚Äôs caught up to the most current version of SU in early 2020.

Thanks to the support from our incredible patrons, we‚Äôre reaching the point of being able to hire more people and create more games ‚Äì taking the lessons we‚Äôve learned from SU and other smaller projects to hopefully push the NSFW gaming industry forward and provide you with even better products/experiences.

No matter how large we grow, we never intend to forget the people and community that made Gunsmoke Games possible. . Through patron-only polls, Discord discussions and various other methods of community involvement, we want to make sure our supporters are able to take an active role in the development and path of Gunsmoke Games. (Within reason, of course.)

We have a lot of exciting announcements and plans for the next year, and we hope you all will come with us for what‚Äôs sure to be a fun (and probably rocky) ride.



We are currently in pre-production of a yet to be named O.C project slated for full release on the steam platform. This project is done completely in house with our team. We are excited to share more news in the future.






In Sunsetrider7‚Äôs first ever title, you play as Tarrlok, who‚Äôs finally captured Korra ‚Äì the Avatar. Your goal is to sway her to your side before help arrives to save her, being careful not to push her too far too fast and losing her forever in the process.

The game is currently playable on Newgrounds and boasts a 4.12/5 score with 1400+ votes and 750k+ views."

 Throughout our time as UYD we have gotten to know a number of you as listeners, strong supporters and even friends.  The style of our show allows us to have a unique relationship with our listeners, we are in constant communication via the internet, phone, email, postcards whatever and because of this we receive feedback, LOTS of feedback. We like to know how you're feeling about the show and what you want more of (less of too). We listen to your suggestions and requests, which we learn from, appreciate and take to heart. Overwhelmingly, the issues that come up are 1) Access to the archives,  all back episodes in one place for stream or download 2) Merchandise, having it available online consistently and shipped promptly 3) More content, whether it be bonus episodes, live shows or video. 4) An easy way for you the listener to support us. 

We love our listeners and we would like to be in a position to offer all the things you're asking for while still remaining completely free, in order to do this we have decided to ask for your help. We hope we can hit the goals we've set so we can maintain the archives, the website and an online merch store w/ employee AND be doing this full-time so we are able to oversee all this new stuff we want to do. We'd also like the time to add more audio and video content! After over a decade of doing this out of pocket we are asking for the UYD family to help us keep this going for the next ten years, we are just not in a position to do this on our own any longer. We've set these goals up and listed different donation options but these are just suggestions, you are free to give whatever feels right to you!

Thank you everyone who has helped already get us to where we are and thanks in advance to you who choose to pledge. XO UYD4LYFE

Sincerely,
Jonathan and Seth"

I'm a guy who listens to pop music.

And since 2009, I've had an Internet video series where I discuss the most overplayed songs on the radio in-depth, under the name Todd in the Shadows. I call myself that because I do this under the cover of shadow while I play my piano.

It's a silly gimmick. But it's a silly show! You can't sit and talk about Pitbull songs without being kind of goofy. But in between the silly jokes, I like to think I provide an insightful and witty look into the music most people write off as disposable junk. Because I don't hate pop music; I love pop music. I love listening to it, writing about it, analyzing what each song means. 

So what specifically do you look at?

I have three main shows: the first is the one I started with, Todd's Pop Song Reviews, where I take one current smash hit song and take it apart, break it down line by line, see what parts work and what doesn't, and analyze where it fits within both current trends and the artists' body of work. And I might liven this up with a bunch of jokes, perhaps by injuring myself in a comical way. Ha ha!

The second main show is One Hit Wonderland, where I take a look at the full careers of bands and artists known for only one song. This series is a trip through music history, as seen through the prism of a particular artist who only had one hit before fading from memory. Why did they fail? Who came along to replace them? Were they any good? Did they deserve better?

And the third, my newest, in Trainwreckords. I do retrospectives at legendarily disastrous albums that ended careers. That's a fun one!

Along with those I do quite a few specials along the way -- Top Tens and Bottom Tens at the end of every year, plus for randomly selected years every so often; reviews of badly received pop-star movie vehicles; vlogs of major musical events like the Grammys; and whatever else passes my fancy.



Because my show is awesome! And I've been giving it to you for free for years! 

Also, there are rewards! Pledge up to $10 a video and you get your name in the credits. Plus I'm planning some exclusives! Perhaps some other things as I see fit! Let's find out together!"

Hello. Thank you for visiting my patreon page. Making a pledge is by far the simplest and the most transparent way to show that you do give a damn about my work.

If you are new to patreon: My Patreon campaign is nothing but a tip-jar. I don't do many ""Patrons-Only"" posts. Also Patreon will charge you every month, so keep that in mind and don't pledge TOO much. I would much rather have you around for a longer period of time, so if you have only $12 to spare, pledge $1 and be my patron for a year :)

And one more thing: please don't feel obligated to continuously support me with the same amount ""till the end of time"". Feel free to edit your pledge back and forth or even cancel it entirely if that is what you must do. I will never hold it against you. Ever!

Thank you for stopping by Studio TRIGGER‚Äôs Patreon page! We‚Äôre an animation studio in Japan, and our motto is to create animation that is both enjoyable for our viewers and creators. We believe if the creators are not having fun with their work, then it‚Äôll most definitely reflect on their final film as well.
If you‚Äôve been watching a decent amount of anime in the recent years, you‚Äôve probably stumbled upon some our titles before (we hope). Some of our more notable titles include Kill la Kill, Space Patrol Luluco, Little Witch Academia, and most recently PROMARE.

So why Patreon?
We‚Äôre a studio that strives for a global audience and values communications with our fans. If you've been in a creative business, I bet we can all relate that a simple feedback is all it takes to make our day great. However, there‚Äôs no denying at times we wished we had an extra buck or two. There‚Äôs been one too many incidents where we had to give up a project idea because it was unprofitable, or simply due to lack of funding. That‚Äôs where you and Patreon comes in! With your support, we would like to forward funds into various aspect of the studio. Possibly a new line of merchandise, attending/conducting more events, or simply providing a little more to our staff.


Sounds great! But what's in it for the patrons?
Ideally, we'd want to provide rewards in physical form. However, that will not be the case for the majority of this project. Instead, we hope to return to the community by providing more 'opportunity' to our fan base. As stated earlier, there's been several incidence where we had to drop merchandise project due to lack of initial funding.
Our initial goal is to prepare streaming equipment so that we can occasionally conduct a live drawing session, or other event involving our creators.
Once our community grows, we hope to introduce more ways to involve our fans.

Disclaimer:
Studio TRIGGER appreciates all and every support from their fans. However, TRIGGER‚Äôs Patreon project will be maintained by a single staff on top of his normal duties. Please refrain from participating if the following applies to you:
-Expects a frequent updates from the studio.
-Expects an immediate response from the studio regarding your inquiry.
-Expects updates/support in any other language than English.
-Expects physical/digital rewards on a regular basis."

Status & Plans



We are moving act1 (flash-based game) to it's end. Currently game includes multiple locations, 12 characters, dozens of interactions, scenes and rest.  


This game started as a hobby project, but raising funds turned one-man project into a small team of 2 core people (me and brilliant artist pToon-T) and 4+ freelancing. Since monthly support grew stronger, I was able to start working over the project full-time, allowing to establish pace for monthly updates and significantly increase game graphics.

I suggest not pledging at the end of the month (25th-31st) or at the

period of time.

If you have doubts about pledging, you can check out my Twitter
for the vids/pics I'm making & be the judge if you should pledge or not.

No Guro, Giantess, heavy BDSM or torture. (Might be a few more)
A reference picture of a similar/exact pose you have in mind is
also appreciated. There's no 100% chance that I'll do the request,
either because I lack of skill to do it, doesn't appeal to me, or I'm
way over my head in requests. You can always leave me a private
message here or on Twitter with your request.
‚Ä¢ Commisions?
No. I like to keep some freedom, and mostly not worry about if I
did what was expected of me.

There's no exact date, some anims will take longer to make then
others & sometimes I'll be out of ideas/motivation, etc.
In short, 1 maybe 2 per month.

The average minimum cost of a short film is around $3,000. That's not something I can easily fund on a regular basis without your help! 

If you become a Patreon at the most basic tier you get: early access to reactions and listening parties, j-pop and japanese kpop releases. At the summer ($10) tier you get drama reactions, variety show, and live stage reactions! The Autumn tier ($20) gets you physical photocards and the Winter tier ($100) is a personalized gift box!

HOW PRODUCTION WOULD WORK

Production would be separated into two months. One month will be pre-production and editing the previous month's short film. The second month is production and where we film the next short film! Then repeat! I'm hoping to do this with the ultimate goal of filming my FIRST feature film and full scale series next year, and this is hopefully practice!



For me the passion lies in telling meaningful stories. But on top of that, I'm also really passionate about Asian American representation and LGBTQ representation. Unfortunately, both are incredibly marginalized groups that so many companies don't want to risk their money on so I've decided to just fund my own projects. I believe Asian Americans are the next big wave in Hollywood, and LGBTQ normalization is inevitable, but someone has to take the first step."

It's a real passion of mine to make these videos that share what I find interesting in music with the rest of the world, and it's been quite a wild ride so far.

YOUR SUPPORT

When you donate to my Patreon, you will support a month of weekly content! Every month, your donation will go towards making sure that these videos keep getting uploaded week after week, allowing me to take the time I need to make the most interesting, fresh and rewarding videos on subjects in music that excite me...and hopefully you too! This will go into research, writing the scripts, filming, shooting B-roll, investment in equipment, studio space, and people who I hire to help me in this endeavor. Studio space in NYC is not cheap, and I want to continue to keep the quality of my videos as high as I can. Donating to my Patreon will support me and my work. 

Basically, Patreon is a way for me to really focus on exactly what I want to do both in the world of professional music and on YouTube and dedicate the time that I need to really let this channel grow and flourish.



So far, this has been a one-man operation, but thanks to Patreon and your support, it's can be so much more! Your support is why I continue to make these videos and share what I think is awesome and worthwhile with the internet.

The lockdown measures currently in place here in the UK means a slight interruption to our normal Patreon offering.

Sadly we can't get into the studio to film Retry: Sekiro or our monthly Early Access Show.

But instead, we've put together a month's worth alternative content we're making from home. You can find out all the details of what we've got coming up in this post: What's Coming to RKG in May...

If you're an Early Access patron, you'll get access to a weekly live Let's Play series in which we attempt a three-player co-op playthrough of The Division 2 every Monday night. These episodes will then go public on Saturdays in the usual Retry slot.

If you're a Producer-level patron, you'll get access to three solo streams with each of us.

And we've got plenty of public streams, too, in addition to Shield Up, our weekly podcast. We'll continue to update the Patreon page as the situation evolves, but hopefully it won't be too long before we can get back to the RKG studio and Ashina.

Thank you for patience and support,

A year ago we did a scary thing.

We quit full-time jobs that we loved to do something new. The community we‚Äôd built over the three-and-a-half years came out to support us, making that decision a little less scary.

We launched Retry, the successor to the show we know you loved, and finally tackled Dark Souls 2. We podcasted, live-streamed, beat Dark Souls on a transatlantic flight, joined a jazz band (sort of), and even took on a World Champion.



None of this would have been possible without you.

We‚Äôve learned a lot over the past year. For a long time we were filming in Gav‚Äôs spare room, and while that brought us even closer together, we were also spending more time working apart. But a year later, and thanks to our Patrons, we now have a studio and are in a position to really offer more.



Today we‚Äôre relaunching the RKG Patreon page. Check out the new, improved tiers and read some of the posts to learn more about what we‚Äôre doing.

We don‚Äôt want to put lots of things behind paywalls ‚Äì we never have ‚Äì but we also want to offer genuine value for the people who support us directly. We think these new tiers offer a good balance.

If you‚Äôre an Early Access patron, you‚Äôll get our main Saturday show early and ad-free ‚Äì Retry: Sekiro starts January 10. You‚Äôll also get access to all episodes of a new show all at once, Netflix-style, one month before it comes weekly to YouTube.



And there‚Äôs lots more, too. So take a read of the tiers and you can find more information about everything on the .



We‚Äôll never be a channel that churns out videos for the sake of having ‚Äòcontent‚Äô, but we definitely want to offer new and interesting things alongside shows like Retry. With your support, we can do all that.

We‚Äôre so excited for RKG: Year Two, and we‚Äôd love to have you come along with us.

Thank you,

Who Are We?

My name is Peter "" Stryxin"" Peko and I'm a passionate Artist / Content Creator / Dungeon Master, I've discovered Dungeons and Dragons in November 2016 and I immediately fell in love. I was making my own maps and sharing them with the community since I started DMing but in February 2018 I've decided to commit and create the content on regular basis, and the Forgotten Adventures was born! 

My name is Grace Papadopoulos and I am an Artist and Dungeon Master. I started out making content for my own campaigns before Stryxin stumbled across me in September 2018 and we realized our drawing styles matched up really well. So now I am a proud Co-Creator for Forgotten Adventures! I focus mainly on humanoid tokens and battlemap layouts.

We started our journey here by creating  but have since branched out into many new directions!

We are currently focusingon creating, and other  that can be used for Map-making or otherwise enhance your gaming experience.

I‚Äôm a 3D hobbyist from Europe, specialized in character creation, animation and VFX. The final public animations can be viewed for free on my twitter channel. I use Blender Eevee real-time renderer for these. If you love my work, this is the best place to help support me. 

WARNING! ADULT CONTENT!

I would like to draw your attention:
When you join, Patreon will deduct the fee. Then at the beginning of each month the next.
If you are uncertain, start supporting with the smallest Tier.
No commission. I'm not fulfilling custom requests. If you have a good idea, you can share it on Discord. I may implement it in the future.

Content
The stories are fiction, their purpose is entertainment. The characters I make are inspired by other games and movies. I would like to process more universes and themes.

I use Blender and Eevee for animation. Why Eevee? Totally free and very fast. This is a new process, I think it has great potential.
I only use self-made models. They are made in Zbrush and Substance Painter.
I make short animations. But I want to make longer films later.
Supporters can access exclusive content on Patreon:
I buy hardware and software from the support. Then helps me work with the project 8 hours a day. I would like to make longer animations. I will have more time to develop characters, environment and assets. I can write more interesting stories.
I am currently making the videos alone, but later I want to expand my team. Firstly: sound designer, voice actress, concept artist, illustrator, hair and makeup creator etc.
Interested in motion capture, virtual reality, augmented reality and interactive movies.
I still want to learn a lot and improve.

Thank you for your support and enjoy it!

Oberoende morgonradio n√§r den √§r som mest kreativ, egensinnig, o√§ngslig, kompromissl√∂s och driven av LUST. Jag √§r mer tacksam f√∂r ditt bidrag √§n vad jag √§r f√∂rm√∂gen att s√§tta ord p√•. Detta √§r min dr√∂m. Jag √§r djupt r√∂rd √∂ver att du vill vara med och f√• detta att h√§nda. Men du undrar kanske? VARF√ñR?

Jag √§r en D√ÖLIG s√§ljare och tycker det √§r s√• himla trevligt att kunna fokusera p√• inneh√•ll ist√§llet f√∂r att jaga sponsorer. D√§rf√∂r hoppas jag kunna klara mig p√• mina k√§ra lyssnares gener√∂sa bidrag. Det √§r ocks√• s√• vi kan garantera v√•rt oberoende. Jag brukar s√§ga att jag vill kunna pissa p√• Arla OCH Oatley i samma program om jag k√§nner f√∂r det.

Det k√§nns ocks√• bra att veta att man har betalande lyssnare. Det sporrar mig att jobba h√•rt och aldrig ta n√•got f√∂r givet. 

Jag (Fredrik S√∂derholm) har l√§nge n√§rt en dr√∂m om att s√§nda morgonradio och fick m√∂jligheten att testa detta n√§r jag vikarierade i Morgonpasset i P3 sommaren 2019. Det var otroligt roligt men jag st√∂rde mig p√• tv√• saker: Vissa √§mnen/vinklar fick inte tas upp och de (oftast) usla l√•tar som tvunget skulle spelas stup i kvarten pajade flowet.

I mitt morgonprogram ""Gott Snack"" √§r inga √§mnen eller vardagsbetraktelser f√∂r kontroversiella eller obekv√§ma och musik spelas s√§llan och i s√• fall bara l√•tar av osignade artister som f√∂rtj√§nar att n√• ut till en st√∂rre publik. I ""Gott snack"" blandas den mysiga interaktionen med lyssnarna fr√•n Ring P1 med uppsluppenheten och expertg√§sten fr√•n Morgonpasset med samtidssatiren fr√•n Tankesmedjan med Howard Sterns tramsiga och lustfyllda uppt√•g. Det b√§sta fr√•n alla radiov√§rldar i en tajt morgonshow m√•n-fredag 07:00 - 09:00.

Usp: Ambitionen √§r att kunna slunga sig mellan br√•ddjupt allvar och extremt l√§ttsamt trams. Dagens morgonprogram √§r ANTINGEN eller. Jag vill ha b√•de OCH.

Jag √§r ankaret men har en roterande ensemble best√•ende av smarta, roliga och mer eller mindre k√§nda v√§nner, kollegor, experter, familjemedlemmar, artister etc. Det viktigaste √§r att folk som √§r d√§r har n√•gonting att S√ÑGA och inte bara √§r d√§r och fyller en stol och etern med DYNGA. 

Reportage/enk√§ter fr√•n f√§ltet blandas med telefonintervjuer och nyhetsklipp. Fokus ligger p√• kultur och n√∂je eftersom det √§r den v√§rld jag bottnar i men alla nyheter och √§mnen kan avhandlas. Jag t√§nker mig ett jobbat program, lite som Breaking News med F&F i radioform. Ett program jag jobbat med i √•tta s√§songer. 

Varf√∂r LIVE och inte bara podd? F√∂r att det fins en NERV i live som d√∂r med podd. Och interaktion med lyssnare √§r s√• j√§vla kul! SJ√ÑLVKLART kommer alla avsnitt √§ven som podd!

Jag har jobbat p√• Tankesmedjan i P3 i snart tre √•r och varit Filip & Fredriks h√∂gra hand i n√§rmare tio. Jag har varit researcher, redakt√∂r eller inslagsproducent p√• n√§stan alla deras produktioner sedan 2010/11. Jag lever och andas inneh√•ll och f√•r utlopp f√∂r mycket via mitt instagramkonto: och min blogg: men k√§nner att radio/podd √§r det format jag brinner f√∂r och √§lskar mest.

Det h√§r √§r min dr√∂m och jag kommer l√§gga ner exakt hela min sj√§l i det h√§r om jag f√•r m√∂jlighet.

Vi vet att produkten Gott snack √§r SVAJIG so far men jag tycker fan det √§r kul med folk, som ist√§llet f√∂r att bara st√• vid sidan om och observerar och kritiserar andra, faktiskt G√ñR n√•t sj√§lva. Jag har l√§nge tyckt illa om den delen av mig sj√§lv. Att jag varit den som pekar och tittar och klagar p√• andra. Jag vill G√ñRA.
Som en fin man p√• insta skrev: √Ñven om detta inte blir som det var t√§nkt s√• har jag i alla fall st√∂ttat en dr√∂m. Dt var j√§vla fint skrivet tycker jag.
Man KAN faktiskt till en b√∂rjan st√∂tta det h√§r projektet BARA f√∂r att det har n√•t med m√§nniskor som v√•gar testa att f√∂lja sina dr√∂mmar. Sen kan man sluta om man inte tycker att vi utvecklas och blir tillr√§ckligt bra. Vi ber bara om en chans.
Om vi alla hj√§lps √ÖT s√• beh√∂ver ingen belastas tungt. Var och en efter f√∂rm√•ga. 

Solidaritet. Gemenskap. Tillh√∂righet. 

√Ñr ni redan patrons men kanske bara ger 1-2 dollar. √ñverv√§g att uppa den g√•van. Patron tar ganska stor procent av sm√• donationer upp till 3 dollar. S√• f√∂rst runt 4-5 g√•r lejonparten till oss.

Jag har i ganska m√•nga √•r nu delat med mig av ALLT i mina kanaler. Jag har delat n√§r jag varit ledsen, n√§r jag misslyckats, n√§r jag varit ful, n√§r jag varit d√•lig, n√§r jag betett mig illa och blivit illa behandlad. Jag har fan delat hela v√§gen in p√• operationsbordet. Jag har fan GETT av mig sj√§lv. Efter f√∂rra sommaren blev extremt tydligt p√•mind om att vi bara f√•r ett begr√§nsat antal hj√§rtslag. Och sen dess har jag k√§nt ett allt mer p√•tagligt behov av att jag m√•ste g√∂ra n√•t eget.
Jag har t√§nkt att jag m√•ste hitta ett s√§tt g√∂ra min EGEN grej. Men inte kommit p√• VAD eller HUR. En vanlig killpodd k√§nns f√∂r trist. Men nu har jag √§ntligen har kn√§ckt det! FEM killpoddar i VECKAN! Jag har sagt upp mig fr√•n mina jobb och kastar mig fan ut handl√∂st h√§r. Och jag litar p√• att ni f√•ngar mig. Det k√§nns skitl√§skigt. Men r√§tt.

What's the Patreon for?
Briefly, it's for us, to keep us doing what we do: entertain you.

Since we started crowdfunding, we've been overwhelmed by the support of our fans. Being able to support ourselves , without having to charge a fee, without having to chase contracts‚Ä¶ is amazing!

Not that won't work with third parties anymore - we love that work too - but at the end of the day we want to only be beholden to ourselves, and to our fans.


That's tricky because the honest answer is ""this Patreon‚Äîcombined with our Twitch.tv subscriptions‚Äîallow us to pursue the creative endeavours we think will best entertain you and excite us, and that could be ""

We thought you might. What's up?


A: We are exploring options to continue making more episodes of Sorry we can't be more forthcoming just yet.


A: We get this question a lot and our first response is ""Thank you for wanting to support us!""
The second response is ""it's honestly up to you""... we get a slightly better percentage through Patreon, but you get the chat emotes on Twitch... totally your call - we're just thrilled you're here.


A: Nope! Patreon is a huge and integral part of our funding, and the of our funding comes from , but we'll still do occasional contract or sponsorship work, and if we come up with a new project that has a scope requiring additional funding, we could run a campaign for that project (an example of this is ).


A: No. We don't want to gate our content. Everything we make will still be free to watch or listen to. We want you to support us because you enjoy our work and to support us.


A: There's, like, SO many of us. 
Seriously though, you're helping pay for 13 full or part-time employees and several more part-time contractors, plus the other artists and creatives we pull in for various projects. We're already thankful that you've even read this far. Our goal is pay more people, so we can make more content.
The dream is for everyone to work here full-time.  You're helping the dream happen.


A: There did! It turns out, however, those Goals didn't make sense for how we operate. 
If we try to new things - to add new Goals - at achievable milestones, we'll quickly hit capacity for what we're capable of producing and we won't be able to experiment with new ideas. And our previous most-upper level Goals were things like ""hire people""... which is still what would happen anyway. We're still trying to approach our work by the rule ""Get to 80%"", with a long-term sustainability viewpoint, so we don't burn ourselves out.  That extra 20% is so that we have to do wild-and-weird things like .

Peace Island is an open-world, story-driven adventure game, currently under development for the PC, Mac, and Oculus VR system.

A mix of science fiction, alternative history, and mystery ‚Äì the game's story unfolds from the perspective of the nine cats who call the island home, when they wake up to find their human companions gone.



‚ÄúPeace Island‚Äù will be (as the name might imply,) a non-violent interactive story which will focus on discovery, atmosphere, and exploration, rather than combat. The player will have the opportunity to experience multiple divergent storylines, as they approach the ultimate decision:

‚ÄúAre the humans worth bringing back?‚Äù



- containing no less than four major settlements, along with dozens of other locations. 






Each interior is being individually hand-crafted - we dislike cookie-cutter architecture in games as much as you do!

Eric (a Line Cook) and Laura (a Social Worker.)  We worked on the project alone for 18 months on a TINY budget that allowed us to occasionally hire a coder or animator to assist us.



When word of the project got out, we were overwhelmed by the attention it received. Since then, it has been a rollercoaster of activity for all of us.



Peace Island has grown into a small, yet dedicated team, including alumni from and .  We're committed to remaining faithful to the community that is funding the project:



In creating this game, we're trying to expand the emotional palette of gaming, and bring a bit of creativity back to an industry obsessed with monetization, loot boxes, and exploiting properties that have long since ceased to capture the imagination.



Depending on the level of your pledge, you will gain access to exclusive premiums and preview Alphas of the game, as we get closer to general release. You can also get access to the full game, upon release!





 Once your patronage has reached 25 dollars in total, you will get the postcard set, access to the Beta, and the full game upon release, even if you cancel your patronage, the very next day.  The same rule holds true for other premiums, such as the Art Print, and in-game name mention.."
ComicsExplained , Comicbook Videos (comicsexplained),"2,429",,,993,Jan 2018,"Sup, I'm Robert Jefferson aka Comics Explained and welcome to the Comics Explained Patreon.

Comics Explained focuses on breaking down comics in a way that even someone who has never read them before can walk in and understand pretty much anything they need to know. Sometimes it's a whole bunch of stories about a character or team, maybe even a whole comic book event like Crisis on Infinite Earths. Other times it's a complex explanation of a character or team's publication history. Either way, if you give me 30 minutes, I'll make you a comic book expert.

While Patreon doesn‚Äôt generate enough on its own to cover ALL operational costs, it does give me a much needed core stability that allows me the resources and wiggle room needed to try and grow out the team, content, & more revenue streams in what can often times be a crazy digital environment. So as a way to say thank you for becoming a Patron, you can get access to an exclusive discord server, patreon only shows like versus videos, comicbook reviews and uncensored stories, early access to my videos, coupon codes for 15% off my merch, Ad-Free versions of all my videos, early access to new content, and a custom Rob Corps Ring (only for select tiers). And these are only a handful of the perks!

Thanks for checking me out, and I'll see you on my Patreon page!

My tumblr username is @aharris00britney. I've been making custom content for Sims 4 for just about 3 years, mainly making female hairs. I started Patreon in April 2018 as a way to help me pay for my college. Which it did! Because of this, and the people who support me I am able to attend the University I want to with a monthly payment plan each semester. So if you pledge, thank you so much for giving me the ability to attend college <3

When will the cc be available for public download?
EA's Policy on Patreon CC is that early access must be released publicly within 21 days of going on Patreon. The majority of the time I have two hairs on Patreon on the 2nd and released around the 16th and 22nd. On the 10th I add the third hair that releases the last day of the month.
So short answer: within 21 days. always.

Is this breaking EA's policy?
No, the Sims 4 team has stated that early release content is allowed:



I will be posting 3 cc posts each month. Most of the time they will be hairs. Sometimes a CC pack will be released similar to ones I had made with ayoshi, dogsill, and wild-pixel on tumblr.


I create content in the Maxis Match style, which means it is made to fit into The Sims 4's style. The majority of the time I create , however sometimes I create male/toddler hairs and clothing.

Casefile began in early 2016 as a one-person operation run by the anonymous host. The podcast has since become an international hit, with a catalogue of over 130 episodes. The Casefile team has grown and now includes a full-time producer, three full-time writers and researchers, a designer, and several freelancers. We remain independently run with no mainstream media affiliates.

In 2019, we launched our second show, From the Files, a monthly companion podcast that delves even deeper into the crimes previously covered on Casefile. In addition to covering breaking news updates and developments, episodes feature a candid interview with guests who have a personal connection to our cases.

We are passionate about respectfully telling the stories of crimes, investigations, and trials of solved and cold cases from around the world, covering everything from infamous events to lesser known cases that deserve more attention. We strive to continuously improve our content, including our research, writing, narration, music, and audio format. All generous financial contributions made by our Patreon supporters help us to do this, while supporting our growing team and ensuring the show remains free to listen to. To show our gratitude, several perks are available exclusively for our Patrons, starting from a monthly donation of just two dollars.

I operate from a simple premise- history does not need to be dull. My vision is to tell history as a story, and let the magic of the events speak for themselves. Here you can find snippets of forgotten history covering everything from Hannibal's elephants to the Wild West, in a format that is fun, engaging, and fits your busy schedule. 

Videos are all between five and fifteen minutes long and cover topics of forgotten and obscure history from throughout time and around the world. 

Your patronage gets you access to all the content on my Silver Creator Award winning YouTube channel The History Guy:History Deserves to be Remembered ad free, plus at least one exclusive video a month and the opportunity to interact with the History Guy, all for just $3 a month. And you'll be supporting this record of the past that helps to inform our present. Making the History Guy takes time, effort, and equipment, and, honestly, vintage military hats do not pay for themselves. It is history that deserves your patronage!

Thank you to everyone who supports The History Guy!"

Our website & channel are focused on delivering high-quality content that discusses PC gaming hardware in great depth. We're excited to offer insights for PC gamers and hardware enthusiasts, with the heart of our content being driven by a desire to educate and inform our readers. We invest heavily in long-form video and written content, and have invested heavily -- financially and temporally -- in building custom tools to improve our test accuracy and resolution beyond the usual capabilities of most of our competition. Your support helps us continue to iterate and improve upon our testing accuracy, and helps us expand our operation into testing new types of components, writing/filming more reviews, and improving overall content quality.

Here are some examples:

[Video] The Disappointment PC (Worst Parts of the Year)
[Article + Video] How Liquid Coolers Work
[Article + Video] Titan V Hybrid Mod Results: 2GHz, Top-10
[Video] NVidia 16-Phase VRM Analysis & Shunt Mod

Our guides have gotten more in-depth as time goes on, and we'd love to produce more videos and articles that explain how each component works. That's where Patreon comes in.

We release content daily on , but hope to improve video content frequency, add higher-end equipment, and support faster web servers going forward. Your support will also help fund our continued convention coverage!

An example of some recent in-depth coverage:

Patreon has enabled us to keep our minimally intrusive advertising structure, so that ads never interfere with content integrity. Thanks to Patreon support, we can survive without some advertisers; we have always been willing to cast aside relations and ads for harder-hitting content, and Patreon only further enables us to do that. We are a journalism-first outlet.

Thank you for your continued support over the last 10+ years! Be sure to for more information on what we do.

Please note: We charge up front on signup (because of the free shirt tier, we do this to make sure we get paid before distribution), Patreon takes it from there."

The Best Show has been going for a long time and it is the funniest show out there! Anybody will tell you! It‚Äôs the place where Scharpling & Wurster do our weekly laff-packed calls, it‚Äôs the home of Gary the Squirrel and sound collages and celebrity guests and DogCember and a million other great things! You can hear it every Tuesday night live on the internet at www.TheBestShow.net and it is available as a podcast the following morning!

The show has always been about the relationship between the listeners and me and Jon Wurster and everyone else associated with the show. We don‚Äôt have the most listeners of any podcast. But when it comes to enthusiasm, I will put The Best Show up against anyone‚Äôs podcast. NOBODY HAS BETTER LISTENERS THAN THE BEST SHOW!

The Best Show is the most creatively satisfying and pure thing I have ever been involved in. I have worked hard to preserve it and keep it going on along my own terms. Reading ads made sense when we started the new version of the show and I am grateful for the companies that supported us over the last two years. But I think there is a more direct means of the show raising money, and it is by establishing a direct line between ME and YOU.

Don‚Äôt forget: we are rolling the dice with this! If we are doing this, we are doing advertising! People asked for a direct way to support the show and now here it is!

And one thing to make clear: THE SHOW WILL STILL BE 100 PERCENT FREE. THE ARCHIVES WILL BE 100 PERCENT FREE. We are going behind a paywall or only providing portions of episodes! So I am asking you to help keep the show free!

We worked hard this past year to make The Best Show as vital and unique as it has ever been, and I would put what we did in 2016 against any other period of the show. I am insanely proud of what we are building every week. We have places to go and things to do, so help us keep it going! Myself and Jon Wurster have been doing the show without getting paid. IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD DO IF WE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY FROM THIS THING.

I am providing different rewards for different support levels! Exclusive content, a new sticker, a fancy pin, crap from the vault and more! But what‚Äôs important is that you do what you can to support the ongoing existence of The Best Show.

Thanks for being a part of this!

Jay Naylor , Erotic Comics and Illustrations (jaynaylor),"2,326",,,2325,May 2014,"Erotic comics and stories can be more than two people getting together. They can be about character, context, and personality-driven situations that make everything even more erotic in the end. That's what I strive to do, whether it's happy and charming, to dark and unsettling; I have a pretty broad range.

Patreon will be where I post just about everything for those who are willing to support my continued work, as well as be able to listen to and value the opinions of those who contribute. To start with, I intend to release every adult comic page I complete on Patreon, as I complete them. This usually comes out to about 2 full color pages per week, or 8 per month, sometimes more (this number may go up as my need to do commissions decreases). I also will be doing warm-up sketches, many of which are serialized in their own mini-stories, and posting them here, exclusively. As Patreon becomes more successful, it may free up my time to do more exclusives for contributors, like side comics for fun and illustrations.

I intend to listen to my contributors. When I finish projects, I always have a list of new stories I can work on, next. I will let contributors weigh in on what they'd like to see next. I'll also listen to those who may wish to sway where my future warm up sketches go, and which characters get more ""development"".

I have three ""universes"" I work in:
Original Life - Is a world just like our own, with the humans simply replaced by anthropomorphic animals.
Cottonwine - A fantasy world of furries, humans, elves, and other derivatives, with embellished sexual hedonism that continually threatens higher civilizations. There's no magic, no gods, but there's enough superstition for people to believe in them.
Lumpkinville - A straight-up cartoon universe set in the generic rural South, complete with humans, furries, witches, magic, spells, and anything and everything I feel like at the moment."

Oh yeah: There are some sweet perks for you, too. Hours and hours of extra footage from my best videos; the Girls I Had Sex with Show, where, yep ‚Äì I tell you the story of every single one, not sparing a single detail about the encounter or my life at that point; my Life in San Francisco magazine series, which is a brutally honest, picture-heavy journal of the most booze-soaked, pussy-infested, yet hopeless part of my life.  Additionally, I go live once a week, just to hang out and answer your questions!

Your support will go to the obvious expenses: gas, cameramen, thumbnails, Vietnamese whores. But as more fellow dirtbags join the Gang, my goal is to ramp up video production both here and on the main channel. High quality, higher quantity. 

With your help, I'll be unstoppable. Our pirate ship is going to pursue, broadside, and open fire on all the shitty, talentless, overpaid Youtube comedians. And then, boys, we're going to piss rum on their watery graves.

As you can see below, we already reached our first goal, at which point the fans found the legendary 5-Blood Blagonball.

We're close to reaching our second goal, at which point we plan to break ground on construction of The Hall. When we reach our third goal, the league will Expand.

Like I said before, I want to thank The Game Band for this unpaid internship. Exposure really is worth more than money. Follow me on . I have a blue check now, which means my posts have been verified as true.

Mega64 ," SKITS, SHORT FILMS, PODCASTS AND MORE (mega64)","2,301",,,1794,Nov 2015,"From public access to the internet and beyond, Mega64 has been bringing you bizarre entertainment from the depths of the video game world since 2003.

You may have seen any of our ""public game experiment"" videos where we take video game weirdness and take it into the real world. Maybe you've seen our written/improv sketches & short films, skewering the game industry or perhaps achieving cerebral high art. Heck, there's a chance you've even seen our original half hour public access TV series on DVD or any of the commissioned videos we've made for Ubisoft, Nintendo, Microsoft, Kojima Productions, Funimation, SpikeTV, and many more. Oh, and we have a podcast too! It never seems to stop around Mega64 HQ.

We've done a lot over the years- and all of it has been done by three guys: Rocco, Derrick, and Shawn. We've also had help from our amazing friends of ours who have pitched in over the years to make it all possible! Everyone involved has strived hard to keep Mega64 going, but this Patreon is about taking our show to the next level.

This is to keep Mega64 independent and free from having to rely on third parties or sponsored content. The more we get, the more freedom we have, the more we can make, and the better we can make it. We can devote our time solely to making stuff for YOU, the viewer.

Mega64 has been around for over a decade. And hey- for a group of friends hanging out and making wacky videos, it's been pretty great! But making funny business into a real business means hustling. Even though we've stayed independent over the years, we made alliances with third parties backing us up to make exclusive content (IGN, Gametrailers, etc.). In times when they aren't around, we relied on commissioned works to fund our productions. That's been our main creative strategy this whole time, and while it's still awesome, it means we have to focus a lot on commercial work while our more wild ideas get left on the table.

Mega64 has never been the biggest thing on the internet. But we'll roll the dice and say we've got one of the most rabid, devoted, and fanbases of any group on the planet. One question we're always being asked is, ""when are you going to go bigger? When will you make more ambitious stuff? When will you take Mega64 to the next level?"" With your support, we can finally shift focus away from trying to make hit commercial stuff, and get to what our hardcore fans truly desire: Mega64 with more creative freedom. Through Patreon, you are funding our ability to create things on a level Mega64 never has before- without the worry of total annihilation or fiscal implosion!



Yeah, sure- We've made fun of crowdfunding. People asking for too little to make their first AAA game, or too much for a 1st Class flight to Seattle. But we don't believe that's the case here. We're not funding construction of a space shuttle or anything else we don't know about- it's just about making the current Mega64 bigger and more ambitious. Any hardcore Mega64 fan knows what we can do when we work hard on a big project. This fund is to make that happen more.



That's totally cool! Mega64 will most likely continue on as it has. We're not going away. But making this stuff isn't easy. You can help support us by  or  Anything you throw our way really does help a LOT. Your regular contributions through Patreon will really be the most reliable way of making sure we can consistently grow and flourish.



Yeah, the most important thing: Thank you. It's because of your support and your viewership that we've had all of these amazing opportunities. No matter what you choose to do, we can't thank you enough for letting us do what we do after all these years."

Kitten Academy , Better Lives for Kittens (kittenacademy),"2,226",,,1527,Aug 2016,"Kitten Academy is a place for kittens to learn to cat.  If you're here, you probably already know who we are and what we do.  Fundamentally, we are kitten foster parents, who work with local no-kill animal shelters to rescue kittens and mother cats from kill shelters and animal control.  We care for the mothers and kittens until the kittens are old enough to be adopted, then we work with the shelter to help them get the kittens adopted to good homes.  Everything we do is to help raise awareness for foster kittens generally, and to help get the kittens we foster adopted, specifically.



We also hope to be somewhat entertaining.  Our most popular feature is our YouTube 24/7 Live Stream.  But we also produce short videos on YouTube of the kittens and the Academy staff cats being cats and doing cat things.  And of course, provide the Kitten Academy website where there is a blog, and additional photos of the kittens that have attended the Academy.



Taking care of these kittens is a labor of love.  Aside from the contributions of viewers and patrons like you, we do not receive any money for this.  In fact, we pay rather a lot; we cover all the food and essentials, toys, and all vet bills, too.  Some months that comes out to quite a bit!  And of course, we also pay for the Academy grounds.

We'll do that in any case.  If we get no support, then we will still give these kittens every bit as much care as they deserve.  But if you can help us, it can make our lives easier, and also reminds us that some humans are (almost) as wonderful as kittens.  



With your patronage (Patreonage?) we only hope to take some of the sting out of the vet bills and food costs.  If we achieve that, then we can look to providing improvements to the Academy such as new toys for the kittens and improvements to the Academy room.  If we achieve and exceed even that, then we'll use the rest to help other fosters at the shelters we work through do the same.  We aren't looking to get rich or even make any profit at all from this -- the goal is to help kittens!  We will provide updates to our patrons explaining our expenses on a regular basis, so you can see where the money you pledge helps us.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, watching our stream, and at least considering becoming a patron of the ."

Send us your questions and we‚Äôll give them exhaustive pseudo-answers!

Is there a park or ride we already covered, but skipped over something major? Did we somehow neglect a slide at Schlitterbahn, or a briefly-open retail cart at CityWalk? Let us know - we‚Äôll go back and make it right!

YuuriVoice , Voice Acting Shenanigans (yuurivoice),"2,175",,,1375,Dec 2016,"Who, what, and why...YuuriVoice?

I'm an ASMR roleplayer, voice actor and writer, but in late 2016 I was just a guy with a microphone and too much time on his hands. I started trying my hand at voice acting for fun, portraying some of my favorite characters and genuinely enjoying myself. During this time I couldn't really find much joy in anything, but for some reason, goofing around on my microphone made me feel at ease.

Then, things exploded. My blog began gaining followers by the dozens, then hundreds, then thousands. People were entertained, comforted, thrilled, all by my voice and writing. My voice, a trait that I used to be ashamed of, had become something that made people happy. I never expected that many people would find themselves interested in my content, or me personally. This was just my escape. Something that let me put down the negative feelings I had on my shoulders for a little while. 

On New Year's Day, 2017, I launched this Patreon page thinking only a small handful of people would be interested. I was shocked once again to find that the same people who loved and appreciated my content were so enthusiastic about what I was doing, they were eager to help make it so that I could comfortable and consistently continue to do this. 


Since we started this wild ride, your support has helped me take the quality of my content to the next level with equipment upgrades and studio treatment for my office. After upgrading all the hardware, we've moved towards putting the money into the content itself. Artwork for original characters, developing unique and exciting stories while also revisiting old favorites and some special appearances along the way! 

Not to mention that I went from no job, virtually no income, to being able to do this full time. I am able to put all of my efforts into my greatest artistic passion because of YOU!


At the lowest tier, you get access to the entire archive of my work! Every post that is publicly available is going to be right here, where you can search, listen, and download them! 

You can find more about the tiers here on the page, but rewards include things like special monthly audios, Q&As, and more! I'm always trying to think of new ways to add value to being a Patron, and will continue to do my best to make being a Patron of mine a special thing!"
Super Eyepatch Wolf , Videos (Supereyepatchwolf),"2,171","$3,553 per Video",$1.64 per Video,1354,Jan 2017,"Hey!

Thanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon! First off, if you're here then chances are you watch my videos, and I just want to say I'm insanely appreciative of that alone, but if you do feel like you'd like to contribute to the channel further, then this is the place to do it.

Who am I?

My name is John Walsh and I run the channel Super Eyepatch Wolf on You tube, I make  video essays on anime, games, wrestling, and kind of just what ever I feel like.

By pledging, you'll be directly supporting the creation of all future videos.

What will the Money be used for?

The most important thing this money buys me is time. Making videos like I do takes a lot of research, writing and editing, generally I'll spend at least two full weeks on a single video, and so the Patreon money will give the time and space I need to do this.

It also allows me to invest in better audio and editing equipment, which will save time and increase the quality of the videos themselves, as well as allowing me to occasionally pay illustrators animators some work for the channel.



Yes - I do make some money through You Tube Ad Sense, however between false copy right claims and You Tube's fluctuating algorithms, it's by no means stable.

I very rarely take sponsorship, and I do not accept sponsorship for any kind of media (I am in the business of giving opinions on media, I do not like the idea of being payed to have an opinion on a specific game/ tv show/ movie or anime). When I do take sponsorship, my patrons will be provided with ad free versions of the video, as well as small bonus extras.




I make 1 to 2 videos a month, and while I know that doesnt seem like a lot, my ethos with the channel has always been quality over quantity.



Nope, I will always make videos about anime because I love it, but I think its a big exciting world out there and there's lots of different stuff I want to talk about. 



My donation type is by video and not by month, which means that if you donate 1 dollar per video, and if I release 2 videos, you'll be donating 2 dollars that month. If you'd like to limit the money you contribute each month you can do so when making your donation. Also, I may occasionally put out short update/vlog style videos, and for these, you will only be charged for my regular video essay style uploads.

Also, in my video ""What Makes a fight Scene interesting?"" I listed a patreon video raffle as one of the rewards,but unfortunately, I was informed that Patreon terms of service don't allow for raffles as it gets them into some murky waters with gambling laws.






Sometimes streams get really busy, but if your a patron you'll have access to my Patron exclusive stream chat meaning I will 100% see your posts!



If you have a question or recommendation,then the Super Eyepatch wolf Discord sever is the best place to reach me, or even just to hang out and chat to other fans of my videos.



Unfortunately the way You Tube is right now means that sometimes my videos are taken down due to false copyright claims, and it can take a couple of weeks to get them back up. But if you‚Äôre a member a patreon I'll send you a download link the moment a video goes down, so you'll have access to all my content at all times.



Yep, a little section at the end which I'll be adding to thank my generous and beautiful patrons."

Rex Krueger , videos about craft. (rexkrueger),"2,160",,,1004,Jan 2018,"My channel is based around a simple idea: you don't need expensive tools to be a craftsperson. Even if you want to explore ambitious crafts like hand tool woodworking, wood-turning, blacksmithing, or metal-work, you can get started with tools you find at a yard-sale.



I'll show you how to restore these tools and begin your first woodworking projects.



Of course, there are some tools you can't find in your neighbor's garage, but I can give you tips on buying specialty tools at rock-bottom prices by looking in places that other people never think of. 



Even better, once you learn the basics of tool restoration and woodworking, I show you how to your own tools with basic materials from the big-box store. I've been amazed at the useful tools I've been able to make and I love showing others how satisfying it can be to make mallets, planes, and wood-turning tools. 





All of this woodworking and tool-making is great, but I want to be more than a woodworker; I want to be an : a person who realizes their creative vision with all kinds of materials and techniques. I don't want to just make furniture; I want to make things no one has ever seen before. I want to be a part of that process through my videos and content.



But none of this is possible without patrons. I'm a full time furniture-maker, and that's a dream come true, but it's also a grind. I spend a lot of time making my living and I don't get much freedom to explore new techniques or make content. 

My patrons make it possible for me to learn something new and then share it with others, so for supporting me and making my ideas a reality!"

*** Thanks for visiting my Patreon. Please note if you wish to pledge do understand that pay up front is on. Meaning that you will be charged as soon as you pledge. Patreon will then charge you again at the start of each month. So, if you wish to support me, you may want to pledge at the start of the month to save money. ***




""The City of Broken Dreamers"" will be based in a setting that heavily borrows from the genres of cyberpunk and cyberprep with a heavy dose of film noir. Based in future Los Angeles corporations and media magnates dominate daily life. Who knows, with the right choices and a little luck, you might even break their hold over the city. But don‚Äôt count on it.

You play as a Ghost, a bounty hunter for hire. Ghosts often have the backing of the rich and powerful and are thus almost immune to the law. Among Ghosts, you are considered one of the best, but behind that lies a man running from his troubled past. Your next mark is a young girl with a hidden, and troubling secret. And when you face her, you‚Äôll face your demons as well. You will meet a large cast of characters, both allies and enemies. How you interact with them will be up to you. Do you keep it professional? Ditch them? Or take them up on a night of hot, steamy, -- well, you get the point.

Are you looking for something with a bit more edge? Where story, and characters comes first? A world with a thick backstory? This will all play out in a ‚ÄúCity of Broken Dreamers‚Äù. The game will be dark, it will be fun, it will be sexy, but most importantly it will be engaging.
 










Available to $10 patrons and up.   .

Depraved Awakening tells the story of a Private Detective and the seedy underbelly of Free City. Filled with choices that dictate how the game will progres. How you decide to play is entirely up to you.



The gameplay plays out as a choice based novel from a first-person perspective. Decisions you make can and often will come back to affect things later in the game.




You are a private eye in Free City. Your latest client has found himself dead. As for how, many suspect suicide, though you're smarter than that. But poking around may get you in some hot water, but then again why would you be a private eye if you weren't looking to face the heat."

Alice Oseman , Heartstopper (aliceoseman),"2,154",,,1455,Oct 2016,"HELLO! My name is Alice Oseman, I'm 25, I'm from the UK, and I'm the writer and artist of a webcomic called Heartstopper. I'm also a published author of four YA novels: Loveless, I Was Born for This, Radio Silence, and Solitaire.



I've been obsessively drawing my characters for years and I'm a huge fan of graphic novels - so I decided to combine two of my passions and start a comic! Heartstopper launched in September 2016, and it is an LGBT romance/coming-of-age story about Nick and Charlie, two boys at a British all-boys grammar school. You can read it online, absolutely free! And though it's about characters from my novel Solitaire, it's a standalone story - you don't need to have read my books to read the comic.

I currently work full-time as a writer and artist, and YOU can help me continue to do that!! It's truly an honour and a blessing to have these things as my career, but it really all relies on you - my amazing readers! I really want to be able to make Heartstopper the best first comic it can be, and I want to continue making cool stories for you, so if you feel like supporting me financially, you can do so here - in exchange for a load of EXCLUSIVE BONUS EXTRAS to do with the comic!"

Welcome to my patreon.

If you don‚Äôt know, i make music,odd machines and try to educate‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ TRY‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve been on patreon for a little over a year now. Since i started a lot has changed. And patreon is definitely a contributing factor to that.

The amazing supporters on my Patreon have helped me fund and justify quite a few big projects that i don‚Äôt think would have been possible without them.

Over the past year i have put pretty much all of the Patreon support back into projects I hope that shows.. and As The support has slowly grown these projects have got more outlandish, more frequent and i hope also more educational.

Right now i am working on my largest project to date, involving a large amount of gameboys to make an extremely large gameboy Polysynth, i‚Äôve been gathering materials for it for the last couple of months, which if it wasn‚Äôt for Patreon i quite simply would not be able to fund, let alone justify spending so much time on such a monolithic beast of wires and retro technology


Recently i‚Äôve got my mate johnny to give us a bit of a hand with filming and putting together footage which is beginning to help with video quality as well as the frequency of videos.


Over the past year i have been increasing what i am offering back on Patreon. From Live MEGAMIX downloads, to builders livestreams i'm trying to keep on improving what i'm giving back.


Who knows where it may end up. I‚Äôve already completed some machines and projects i never would have thought were attainable. And i will proceed to try and push my personal envelope in the realms of wacky electronic machine. The sky is the limit!!! also an end goal is a place called ""museum of everything else"" where anyone can come and enjoy these machines.

so thanks a lot for listening.

Wether you become a Patreon or not! i hope you enjoy the videos, as there are plenty more to come!!!"

Old Gods of Appalachia , podcasts (oldgodsofappalachia),"2,127",,,341,Oct 2019,"Overview
Old Gods of Appalachia is an eldritch horror anthology podcast. Our world, an Alternate Applachia, centers around the concept that the oldest mountains in the world were never meant to be inhabited. Long before anyone lived in these hills, beings of immeasurable darkness and madness were entombed beneath them. In this bygone age when the Appalachians were much grander in size and scope they served as the perfect prison to contain the darkness. As time passed and the walls of the prison wore thin, the Things that slept below began to stir and call to those who would hear them. The outcast and impoverished with nowhere else to go, the frontiersman and the opportunist willing to kill and die for glory or land. They called the richer men and their machines to search and dig. To seek and find, to follow and serve. To shut out outsiders and keep our dark and bloody land for ourselves and our masters.


Alternate Geography
Old Gods is set in an Alternate or Shadow Appalachia. A world eerily similar to the hills and hollers we‚Äôve grown up with but with some noticeable differences. The names of towns and counties will be different. Historical events will be slightly shifted. Our stories will pass through hundreds of years of this Appalachia‚Äôs history. To link our story to actual Appalachia, the center of many of these first stories will be based on actual disasters that have occured in the region but these events will also have been changed, composited and altered on this side of the veil. No real names will be used for private individuals who might have been part of the real life inspirations for our stories. Any resemblence to actual persons is purely coincidental or the will of darker forces that we do not understand."

I'm a digital artist who creates comics, illustrations, and fanart; my favorite subjects to draw are explicit sexual content and queer romance. In general, I like themes that are dark, fantastical, and dramatic.

Starfighter is probably the project I'm most known for: it's a sci-fi, explicit, queer comic that you can read online for free. (It even had a visual novel released based on it called Starfighter: Eclipse, which was completed in 2015 after a successful Kickstarter.) It is now fully complete!üéâ

The Second Tier will debut my new comic project, Mickey + Jessica:


This will be a dark romance drama of two women.. It will involve some violence, drug use, and will be NSFW/sexual. (The style will be a little grittier than Starfighter- it will look more like the drawings above!)

I hope you will enjoy it!üôáüíï

The Third Tier will have a new project, Lucifer's Garden:


While I work on Mickey + Jessica, I plan on making a new project: It will be about a captured angel and the devil that keeps him.. üò≥üí®üíï It will take place in a fantastical world full of monsters! (The angel has some animal tails, ears, etc)

This comic will be very similar to in exploring dark themes and other kinks! (Likewise, there will be dub/non-con elements, varied sex, and other elements that are very mature, so please use discretion!) Patrons at this level will a receive a free PDF of the finished comic.


I am using Patreon as a way to sustain myself as an artist and as a way to connect with fans and supporters!

Introduction

Hi, I go by the name of Nb, and I am the creator of Naked Bakers. By pledging to my Patreon you allow me to keep producing and growing the show! All the content I produce is completely crowd funded, and I am only able to keep working on it because of the support I receive from you. :)

Make sure to check out  to get an idea of all the content I have in my library. There is over 3 years of content there!



Naked Bakers originally started in 2017 with the goal of crowdfunding a production company to produce a naked baking show. . Times were tight too. I had recently been laid off, so I could barely even afford ingredients (go check my first goal). But I stuck with the dream and rode out the unemployment check right to the end. Fortunately, by that time, I was able to develop an amazing community that supported me here Patreon. That allowed me to keep focusing on Naked Bakers full time, covering all my basic bills and meager production costs.

It didn't stop there though. Thanks to all of the support I received, and still get, from my fans on Patreon, I have been able to grow this it into a full blown production company. , and we employ a team of editors and a .

This isn't the end either. We just recently launched a brand new website as the foundation of my video library, and I have huge plans for that in the future. ;)

We're the team behind the free multiplayer browser game Pony Town.

Pony Town is a social game in which you can create your own pony and hang around in a pixel environment, chatting with other players, role-playing, or celebrating seasonal events.

In the future, we hope to expand it into a proper sandbox MMORPG game focused on farming, crafting, exploring the world and building houses and towns with other players. The project is very ambitious and we don‚Äôt know the exact final scope yet. We‚Äôre inspired by games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft or Factorio.

You can play the game right now at  https://pony.town/

In order to provide updates with new features and fixes for the game we're working full-time on the game and to keep this up we need your help.

Female Agent is a text-based RPG.  It stars a Western intelligence officer, sent undercover into Bangkok's red light district.  She'll have to navigate her way through a sex-fuelled urban underbelly to take down a dangerous international terrorist.

Will she succeed or become trapped in Bangkok's criminal underworld?


Current state of the game
Right now you can create your own unique character, including a dynamic customisable avatar, and play through the story-driven tutorial that leads up to your operation in Bangkok.  Many features are partially implemented, with more being added nearly every day.

We're currently working on Version 1.6, which is an upgrade to the sex scenes.  This update will make the sex scenes more interesting and...well...sexy.



The endgoal is to create a text-based open-world RPG ‚Äì with dynamic images and artwork ‚Äì which will open up once you're actually in Bangkok.





The game features a dynamic avatar of your character, who changes clothes and facial expressions according to what's going on in the story.  You can customise her hair colour, hairstyle, eye colour, bra size, body type, and facial features.

In the future we plan to implement procedurally generated illustrations of key scenes, starring your individual character.



I love tabletop roleplaying games, and it's been my goal from the beginning to replicate the level of story-driven interactivity of a tabletop game to

G.U.R.P.S., the Generic Universal Role Playing System, has been around since 1986 and is designed to work for any game setting.  I looked into licensing it for , but couldn't get permission.  So, I've created my own system ‚Äì which I'm called S.U.R.P.S. ‚Äì specifically for this game.

It makes dice rolls and decides what the outcome of those rolls means to the story, while also creating dynamic in-world effects of story developments.  For example, being ""Buzzed"" adds +1 to all rolls, mimicking a character's inhibitions being reduced by alcohol.

For casual players, S.U.R.P.S. will run in the background.  You'll see a % chance of your agent succeeding at a given course of action, and the situation will play out accordingly.  For those as into RPG systems as I am, you'll be able to drill into your dice rolls and understand precisely what's being factored behind the scenes for any given action.

This means that there will be a levelling system that includes stats, perks and everything else you'd expect to find in any other traditional RPG.  Some story options will require specific perks and stats, making each playthrough unique and giving the game higher replay value."
Miracle Of Sound , Songs and music videos (miracleofsound),"2,065","$3,948 per Song",$1.91 per Song,1253,May 2017,"Hi!

Hey guys, I'm Gav and I make songs. I'm best known for my music inspired by various games, movies & TV shows which have gathered over 180 million Youtube views! 


What is this Patreon page for?

Making a living as a musician is tricky these days. With streaming overtaking album sales and platforms like Youtube becoming less reliable with monetisation, artists need other options. 

The high quality of my productions is due to over 2 decades of dedication, work & practice. I've given my whole life to making music and platforms like this one allow me to do that while also having a job.

My job includes:
- Composing
- Recording & engineering
- Playing (and buying) all the instruments & singing the songs
- Mixing (this is by far the most time consuming part)
- Mastering
- Promotion, social media etc...
- All managerial, clerical & financial stuff

That's a lot of work for one person! My songs can often take over 100 hours to create & that's not including the promotion & managerial stuff. In the past I worked on music in my free time while washing dishes in hotels or waiting tables or working in retail... trying to balance that double life wasn't easy and it was hard to find time to record my songs, let alone produce them to the level of quality my audiences now enjoy.

So when you become a patron, you're sending some cash my way in order to let me keep making the things you enjoy :)  In order to keep making this much music to this standard, it needs to stay my full time job.  




The music itself will be the main reward here. There will also be some early access to in-progress songs/artwork/demo mixes/behind the scenes prose etc and Tier 2 Patrons will get access to a private group chat server on Discord. My creation process is intensely private & solitary so there won't be many livestreams or that kind of thing but you will be able to ask me questions, give feedback & stuff like that :)  

I don't believe in putting any exclusive songs behind a paywall, I want every fan to be able to hear every song I release regardless of their financial situation. My work is all about getting high quality, polished tunes made for all of you guys and that is what you'll be supporting. If that's enough for you to want to contribute then awesome! If not, I completely understand.

NOTE: [reward tiers are not concrete and may change slightly based on fan feedback, but you will never lose anything you're getting I will only add]

Thank you to everyone who chips in - you guys have always been super supportive of me. In fact it was you - the fans - who suggested joining Patreon in the first place. So thanks for letting me do my dream job, y'all are the best :)

„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØÔºÅMy name is Dogen. I make comedic skits in Japanese on YouTube, and teach Japanese phonetics here on Patreon!

American Japanese Episode 1


I began uploading original Japanese content to YouTube in January 2016, with the hopes of eventually using the platform as my primary means of living. In May, a kind individual The community was very welcoming; I saw a major boost in subscribers and received many questions about how I studied Japanese. Several members even encouraged me to create a Patreon page. Awesome! A few months later popular Japan-interest website  featured me in their weekly newsletter.










I currently work full time, and script, shoot, and edit videos during lunch breaks, off days, and late at night. Though I do have a strong command of the language, writing and performing new content each week in Japanese is time consuming, and frequent business trips often complicate scheduling. Your support on Patreon helps me make the transition from salary-man to artist, and, more importantly, allows me to share stronger content such as the longer pieces from  , or even entire chapters from . Having additional free time also lets me give back to the community through Japanese phonetic lessons.

Despite being a fundamental part of the language‚Äîand often the defining factor between sounding foreign and native‚ÄîJapanese pitch-accent is seldom taught in classrooms or textbooks. In many cases, this causes Japanese learners to develop bad habits which become very difficult to fix down the road. I try provide the Japanese learning community with a set of tools meant to prevent and fix these habits. In my Patreon video series  , I talk about my experiences picking up Japanese as a teen, introduce useful phonetic practices, and break down the dozens of complicated phonetic patterns I learned while earning my degree in Japanese linguistics.




Though a fair amount of information on Japanese phonetics exists, it can be hard to find, and difficult to understand without advanced Japanese and linguistic knowledge. Resources are dispersed and sometimes contradictory. My goal with (and its supplementary Instagram series ) is to consolidate everything into a single, easy to understand curriculum framed in the context of my personal learning experiences. I'm aiming to create the definitive guide to spoken Japanese.

And that's about it! I'm opposed to the vlogs-for-views mentality, so having a platform like this which allows me to focus on content creation rather than selfies and memes is truly liberating. It's an amazing time to be a second-rate writer with delusions of grandeur. I mean artist.

Thank you all for the amazing support!"

xCodeh , Demonetized YouTube Content (xCodeh),"2,053",,,1121,Sep 2017,"I've been a YouTube creator for over 10 years, starting my first channel back in 2007. For the past few years, I've been able to sustain myself and make a living creating videos on my YouTube channel: xCodeh. Recently, with YouTube's changes in policy and demonetization rules, about 50% of my content is now ""limited to no ads"". This means, the content that I built my channel on, and the content my audience wants to see is no longer ad-friendly content. Basically, I will make little to absolutely nothing from this point on making YouTube videos, unless I completely change my format and character. I was very hesitant to make a Pateron, I've never like the concept, but at this point I don't believe there is a way to continue making videos without an alternative source of income. I could pump out sponsored/paid videos left and right, but who wants to see those?

Why not get a job like the rest of us? If I were to get a full time job and work 40+ hour work weeks, the amount of time I'd have to create videos would not be enough to create good content.

This also opens up a whole new way for me to bring you videos I wouldn't normally be able to upload to YouTube! By pleging support you'll get access to unlisted videos posted by me, with content I wouldn't normally be able to post on my main channel. "

My one true passion in life is painting and I'm here on Patreon to share my love of painting with you.
I've been painting for over 20 years now. I sell my paintings all around the world by harnessing the power of social media. Before I started painting full time I was a school teacher so I have a background in education. Now I am combining my love of painting with my teaching experience. 

I have had the pleasure of teaching online watercolour classes to over 20,000 students worldwide. Daily questions about my painting techniques and the materials I use are asked through my email and social media platforms. At times it can be difficult to answer everybody. So, I recently started adding watercolour tutorials to my and the response has been fantastic. However, the amount of time required to produce good quality video tutorials is enormous, see my video here:

I'm Neil, known here as AfternoonMaps. I love Pen and Paper RPGs and for the last few months I've been creating battle maps for fun and for the kind people that support me here on Patreon. I started off making maps for my home game and thought ""Hey maybe other people would like these"". It turned out that some people do like them and I've been creating a few maps a month for a while now.

My goal for each month is simple... create between 2-4 battle maps along with some fun ideas on how to use them in your game. The amount of maps launched in a month largely depending on my free time and the complexity of the maps. I work as a freelancer, which basically means some weeks I'll have lots of time to create maps and other weeks I'll be unable to create maps due to work commitments. I take feedback and suggestions from my Patrons on what they want to see next, where I can improve and what they find most useful. You can take a look at my public launch posts to see what maps I've released over the last few months and I'll often post public updates for my Patrons and Followers to keep them up to date on what I'm working on next.

Now I even run my own campaigns when I have time.

Here is an example of my most recent maps!


















I hope my scribbles are useful to a few of my fellow geeks. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside to think that maybe, in some small way, I can help a storyteller bring their world to life just a little bit more. That's just so awesome!

To find these exclusive Patreon Pieces, look for ""Poll Winner"" or ""Bonus Exclusive"" under the Featured Tags on the left side of my Patreon. As of the time of this writing, that's only one piece... but as the weeks and months go on, the number of exclusive pieces on my Patreon will continue to grow!

Join in on the fun today!



As of today (the date above this), this Patreon is no longer on a month delayed release schedule. , as I have had to remove all noncon and dubcon material from the Patreon Page in order to conform to Patreon's Community Guidelines.

Everything I write is posted to either Questionable Questing or Hentai-Foundry, or both. Links can be found below.

If you choose to pledge to my Patreon Page, you do so simply because you want to support me... or because you want to participate in my Patreon-Only Weekly Prompt Polls in some fashion! Either way, thank you for your time and your consideration in checking out my Patreon.



Hey there, I'm Cambrian and I really love writing fiction, especially erotic fiction. I hope to turn this into a source of income for me so I can do more of it.

Without this Patreon, my ability to write for all of you will diminish over time as I have to ""Grow up"" and ""Get a real life"". If you like what I do, like what you see from me, and want to see more of it, please consider contributing to my Patreon! You'll be helping me build my dream of making a career out of being a writer!

If you support me as a reader or a patron, thank you.

Homestuck , Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon (homestuck),"1,972",,,347,Oct 2019,"Paradox space has fallen, consumed by a black hole large enough to contain a multiverse. No longer must our heroes toil in the service of the ""alpha timeline."" The Prince and his Seers seek to preserve the Canon-That-Was at great personal and narrative cost. But inside the black hole, those who the paradox once discarded seek to claw back to relevance and escape to the Fanontinuum, a new fabric of story and space woven by the hands of new narrators, thousands of voices that fill the vacuum left by the death of the author.

This is not Homestuck. But it is not not Homestuck. This is...

HOMESTUCK^2: BEYOND CANON

Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon is an official continuation of the cult-classic webcomic Homestuck and a follow-up to The Homestuck Epilogues, dropped as a major event in April of this year. Homestuck 2: Beyond Canon takes a combination of Andrew Hussie's original writing and plot outlines and concepts and joins him with a team of new, diverse voices to expand the compelling narratives of Homestuck's most (and least) beloved characters.

This story was originally created by Andrew Hussie and will be told by him and a new team. This Patreon supports What Pumpkin and all authors and artists on this project. Additional funding beyond what's required to create the project will support new projects from What Pumpkin, and a portion of the proceeds will be directly shared with the creative contributors to this comic.

I mostly draw big and strong women, of the suggestive or NSFW kind. I'm probably mainly known for the big psychopath glowing eyes girl and the frog with the big ass. As you can see, those are very important subjects for humanity to move forward, so your support would be very important !

I grew up with videogames, anime and traditional fantasy, which is also my main inspiration for drawings many years later. What little I know I learned starting from age 27, completely incidentally, following youtube tutorials, all classical painting-oriented, so you'll find aspects of that here. I just realized I really liked the creation process so I stuck with it, and that's what I do for a living now. Basically, imagine if Leonardo da Vinci watched cartoons instead of learning anything.

You can see my stuff at [Tumblr], [Twitter], [Deviantart], [Hentai-Foundry] -!NSFW WARNING!
I've been planning to use patreon for a long time for the possible additional income, since I don't make a lot. Please spend responsibly. Anyways, thank you very much for liking the drawings and for your help should you choose to!

It's your boy, Jay Hunter! I've got one pitch, I wanna bring out more OSW more often!
That's it! Making OSW is my favourite thing in the world, and it kills me to tell you guys when episodes are delayed, and that in general OSW has become less frequent - and this is how I can make time! Creating episodes are a massive 1-man operation (aside from the recording session, everything OSW is done by me), and I love doing it. OSW is like another full-time job on top of my job, and with your help I'll be able to make more episodes more often, and pass the slavings onto you!



So we've set up NOGGER UNIVERSITY, which is our Patreon! Pledges will go straight back into making the show. It'll mean I can spend more time editing OSW and less time on not-OSW, as well as buying drinks for the lads/feeding OOC's Faberg√© egg addiction.





‚Ä¢ Our eternal gratitude!
‚Ä¢ Being personally responsible for getting new OSW episodes out quicker!
‚Ä¢  Enroll/Sign up at any tier, I'll send you something in the mail, because you're a fucking legend!
‚Ä¢ At $5+ you'll get access to There'll also be cool stuff like deleted scenes from past episodes.
‚Ä¢ At $10+ I'll send you a What Bar Chocolate Bar in the mail (anywhere in the world!). It costs about a tenner to make and send so know that I love you!
‚Ä¢ There's also offers including me reviewing , and sending you cool merch in the mail, have a look at the rewards to see if anything tickles your fancy (ooh-err!)

In any case, every OSW episode will remain FOC! free of charge, and every dorrah will help get out the next episode a little quicker.  Thanks for reading, and remember..."

This is Tommy, John, Doc, Chris and Kyle, and welcome to our Patreon!

We started this page as a way to stay connected to the WOLFPACK while everyone is stuck at home, social distancing.

We want to offer you guys exclusive content like interactive live rehearsals, tour diary videos, personal vlogs, as well as livestreamed acoustic performances only available to the die hard Wolf Pack members.

We‚Äôre also gonna do updates and check ins, so you guys can ask us questions directly in real time about music, sneakers, mental health, how to be in a band or really anything you want!

With all the shelter in place protocol interrupting the spring tour season we thought that this was the best way to stay connected to you guys and share music and hope as we all get through this rough patch together

So come join us as we show you how we‚Äôre getting through this quarantine, by jamming with us, working out with us, learning some cool guitar riffs so you can play our songs at home, or even just to fool us around with us, to ease some of the worry and boredom we‚Äôre all going through.

So remember boys and girls if you wanna take a trip, why not just sit at hope and RIP!

What Should I Read Next isn‚Äôt just about book recommendations. It‚Äôs also a show that gets to the heart of how reading changes the lives of book lovers.

My conversations with guests over the years have proved this nearly two-hundred-fold. Our guests have shared touching stories about how their favorite (and not-so-favorite) reads have provided inspiration and readerly satisfaction, forged new friendships, pulled together their family, provided emotional healing, broadened their horizons, reconnected them to their heritage, inspired a career change, or simply brought much-needed laughter into their life at just the right moment.

As a loyal listener, you know you‚Äôre already supporting the show just by tuning in every week! We appreciate this so much. And thoughtful emails and comments from listeners have bettered the WSIRN conversation since the beginning. , I‚Äôm most excited for the quarterly livestreams, when I‚Äôll get to chat and play matchmaker with far more listeners than we‚Äôll ever be able to book on the show!

I'm Shibby, here to have fun and make my own unique style of audio art.

I love writing intense scripts, recording alluring audios, and editing in layers, binaurals and all sorts of effects that will send you deeper then you've ever been. That will make you more submissive than you've ever felt. Sub space and trance combined into one blissful experience is the goal.
And I'm really quite good at it.

You love it.
Going down into trance for me. Feeling the intense sensation my voice causes to run along your skin. All of your body. Fingertips lightly grazing over you, making your body shudder in bursts of intense pleasure. All at my command. All feeling soooo amazing, as I guide you towards explosive experiences and intense sensations you will never find anywhere else.
Both of the purely mental, and very physical variety.

Deeper and Deeper....



Thanks to my supporters, this is my full time career now- which is awesome because I used to do it just for fun!
Now thanks to you, It's still incredibly exciting, But I also have the time I need to make whatever wicked ideas my mind comes up with instead of scrounging around for time in between shifts.


is also a great place to hang out just to find out more about me, find reviews of my files, ask questions, see pictures of my dungeon, and if you aren't a patron, finding out what's going on in my world.

You can find out more about that and my Discord channel 






I also record a lot of scripts from GWA, as it helps me expand my collection and gives you so much more to listen to.

I have a lot of kinks, mostly related to Female Domination, that comes across in many of my files.

I also have a huge exhibitionist kink, so making all sorts of kinkiness appeals to me- and I just love being the one to show you new kinks, and help you accept the ones you have as the sexy spice of life they are!





Here are some of the free files I recommend you start with:

My starting file in FemDom Guided Meditation is a 25 minute HFO file called . My very first effort in a series called ""Good boy"" which installs a return to trance trigger, and a reward trigger whenever I call you a good boy- right before I snap you to bliss.
Once you have the triggers in this file firmly entrenched in your mind, there is a whole series of files that follow-
Clench
Slave. Obey.

Lord Arioch , Seeds of Chaos (LordArioch),"1,911","$12,040 per month",$6.30 per month,1691,Feb 2016,"Seeds of Chaos is a dark fantasy eroge made in Ren'py, inspired by the worldbuilding of Berserk, Dark Souls, The Witcher and other epic fantasy series. Seeds of Chaos explores the story of Rowan, a retired hero of renown, who is forced to descend into an endless well of depravity and corruption. 

Seeds of Chaos is a visual novel experience with a few twists. While it uses the typical visual novel way of presenting scenes, it strays away from the norm by adding unique features and placing the emphasis differently. Unique additions are the exploration of a large overworld map, random events that spawn when criteria are met, and castle management elements. On the visual novel side the game is inspired by the deep branched dialogue inspired by Obsidian, Bioware, and the Witcher games. These dialogues are designed to be meaningful, and often affect later meetings and events.

Circa Survive , Music and Community. (circasurvive),"1,888",,,184,Apr 2020,"Dearest Creatures,

For years now we have heard from so many of you asking us to revamp Creature Club (our initial iteration of a ""fan club"") and to make it a thing once more.  Well, it's finally happening.  The timing couldn't be weirder but honestly we are totally here for it and we hope that you are too.  

Somewhat ironically, we have been working on this Patreon for months now.   Long before this virus would change the landscape for touring musicians like ourselves we were already finding it ever more challenging to continue to do what we do in a way that is both deeply satisfying for you as well as sustainable for ourselves.  This current situation of isolation gave us an indefinite amount of time at home and a deep desire to connect so we bumped the timeline on this project to as soon as humanly possible and now here we are! 

It's become clear to us that there are a number of new ways that we can engage & share with you and it wasn't until recently that we learned we could do all of them here on Patreon, not only in a technologically efficient way but in a way that could sustain us financially as artists in a time where it has become increasingly difficult for us to do so through normal channels.

Circa has always been a strange beast.  We have never really been a band that catches on through a TV channel playing one video or a radio station playing one song... Our music exists more as a relationship or a language if you will and for most it takes time to learn & appreciate something like that.  This is why the connection we all share is so special, it feels like a secret language; it always has and it always will.

Through the years we have been emboldened by your love to push our creativity farther and to hold onto our artistic integrity tighter.  This continues as we sail the seas of unending change that relentlessly floods the 'music industry'.  While we have always existed one foot in and one foot out of said industry, we are not immune to the growing challenges for artists to monetize their craft.  So instead of continuously being faced with dilemmas of corporate compromise we have instead once again decided to turn to you, our friends and supporters to trade some energy.  

This Patreon will offer a way for us to give you all the stuff that we'd want from our favorite bands :









There is really no limit when it comes to what is possible here, surely it will only get cooler and cooler the more of you that are here. We may add more tiers down the road but for now you will find 4 Levels of Creature Club membership with a wide spectrum of perks throughout.  We will be working hard to make sure that each level has it's own distinct value and utility.  With that said it's very easy to edit your monthly pledge up or down as you please so you never have to have any commitment anxiety in that regard.  

A given correlation that will exist is, the more financially backed we become by you, the less we have to compromise with outside entities in any form.  This isn't to say that we will stop collaborating with record labels and the like but in general this Patreon will insure that we will never feel forced to do so.  

We are all about experimentation and honestly have dreamt of this moment from the start of the band.  If all goes the way we think it will, this Patreon has the potential to deepen all aspects of our relationship to you and how we create.  We couldn't be more excited to share more of our process and our personalities with you in away that is a mutually beneficial exchange of energy.  

Of course if you can't afford to support us here, we completely understand, if you wouldn't min simply helping us spread some awareness about it, that will be of equal or greater value to us. Thank you from the bottom of our collective heart, for all gifts past, present and future. 

As always, stay safe. Âèà

I always liked to draw, especially fanart of sexy female characters. There is something magical about it that is indescribable. It let's me draw for a long time without feeling any tiredness. It gives me the urge to try harder and get better. My goal is to do what I love for a living. So if you like what you see becoming a patron is a way to support me.

As a patron you will receive patron only rewards depending on the tier you are in (see list on the side) for each set of drawings I'm completing. Depending on the method I'm using the number of finished pieces each month will vary. I like to try out new techniques and I really dislike drawing under pressure so I think it's better to support me for the work I have done instead of per month. I will try to go for 3-5 well rendered artworks per set (2 sets per month). NSFW versions will also be drawn for most of them. 
If you want to make sure to receive all rewards your monthly limit should be able to cover 2 sets.
I usually send out rewards around the 8th of each month.

My illustrations are fully colored, you can check out some of them:







I will also sometimes be livestreaming on Twitch:

Those Conspiracy Guys , Podcasts (thoseconspiracyguys),"1,828",,,1834,Sep 2015,"On the 11th September 2014 Those Conspiracy Guys was launched with the podcast and accompanying website. Since then it has grown to a chart topping, award winning, multi million downloaded podcast with some of the most dedicated (and opinionated) fans in the podcast world. It was a dream of mine to have this podcast as my job and with your kind support, it has become a reality. TV and Radio appearances; podcast appearances; reviews and write-ups in hugely popular publications like NME, The Guardian, and The Sun; and multiple awards for the podcast and the website have cemented TCG as one of the top shows in the genre :)

The show has changed over the years, with guests and presenters coming and going and the scope of the research and content growing into something that is unique in the podcast world. I wanted to foster deep conversation around these well-worn topics and to catalog and compile a conspiracy compendium of all of the available information out on the internet. It is first and foremost a comedy show but the content is scraped from what is left of the open internet but now includes books, documentaries, and even first hand interviews with the people involved. 2019 is a very different informational landscape from when the show was developed in 2014. Conspiracy Theory is classified as 'domestic terrorism' these days!

I do want to talk about everything and anything and no topic is too outlandish (except the ones with really good lawyers) but our back catalog has some heavy hitters like The Vatican and Holocaust Denial. I want to examine history from a new perspective and use different accounts of well known events, personalities and famous conspiracy theory topics and tell a story that is palatable for everyone. I want to make it comfortable for beginners and juicy enough to satisfy the long term conspiracy fans.



There is an around this show now too and people are connecting and conversing on all our social media. Its like an examination by committee nowadays and if I miss something in the show I can be sure that there is someone out there that will have the knowledge to fill in the gaps. TCG fans are congregating on our socials but a fantastic community of Patreon supporters are on the TCG Discord server (details are below) The show has often been reviewed as 'listening to a bunch of my mates talking about conspiracies' and I want to trawl through all the info I can find on a topic and synthesise it into a palatable, relatable, funny, friendly and entertaining format all while keeping the research top notch and the information flowing.

Ive been down the rabbit hole since 2000 and Ive watched it all transpire; and Ive never been more confused :) I like to think my longevity in the conspiracy game has allowed me to remain balanced and be able to argue both sides of the tale rather than succumbing to the die-hard tin foil hat merchants and poorly crafted sci-fi stories that now litter the internet. The digital content surge in the past few years has flooded the space with partisan content creators and I want TCG to be a different vibe and to be able to bring you classic and modern conspiracy theories and true crime stories that you may already know and some you might not!



Patreon is the life blood of TCG and is my main income to be able to continue this show full time. The different kinds of shows I produce now make it perfect for sharing exclusive content here on Patreon and the sheer amount of TCG stuff that is out there right now means no one will have to go without! I want my Patreon supporters to get exclusive access to some content and early access to everything and all be for Patreon supporters.





Thank you so much for your support of this show and of my ideas and effort! I really appreciate it and I strive to produce the best content I can and to be as informed and educated as time allows. I would rather be great than be first and the hyper-fast news cycle that we are subjected to these days means that I might be slow off the mark; but when it does come, its considered, analysed and deeply discussed. 

The show only exists because of your support and I hope you find everything you want on this Patreon page. Some of the things aren't super easy to find, but hopefully with the above instructions and a quick skim through the past posts, you'll be able to figure it out without much hassle. If you need anything, just send me a DM here and thanks again for your support! <3

I greatly appreciate your generosity in helping fund the testing supplies and equipment for making the videos.  EVERY penny donated is spent on buying products that viewers want tested, test equipment or other expenses directly related to making videos.  Patreon donations allow me to decline all sponsorship opportunities and remain unbiased, since I have nothing to sell nor do I have a corporate sponsor to please.

So why compare products?  We all want to buy products that deliver good results. It's hard to trust the claims of manufacturers of products, because they have something to sell. I don't have anything to sell, and I'm not sponsored by any manufacturer or company. My purpose is to test products, additives, glues, epoxies, tools, and all sorts of things to find out which products actually work. Buying these products to test is rather expensive and the support helps a lot.

My goal is to create an array of different minis each month. Providing 10+ unique character/monster/ creature creations with different poses, added accessories, bases, environment pieces, and weapons. This page originally focused on dragons and will strive to always provide 2 beautiful or nasty dragons, every month, on top of a large amount of other minis. New spins old designs, bring their concept into the 21st century and make them detailed and dynamic. Make you want to throw away those traditional minis and use what I create.

-------------OCTOBER MINI PACK-----------




                                                                              











   I've been creating 3D characters for over 12 years and I have finally come to the realization, I want to share what I create and have wanted to for some time. In the hope people enjoy what creations I/ we come up with. One of the best feelings is knowing something created can be taken outside its 3d form on a computer and put in someones hand, no matter what you do with it, and enjoy it. The goal is to involve you guys as much as possible. There are hundreds of dragons I can create but finding concepts and poses everyone else enjoys, is far more satisfying.

I hope you enjoy my work and dont hesitate to send me a message with questions or comments.

Thank you so much for visiting my page and if you made it to the bottom and you are reading this, you've already done more than I could ask for!

The Bible Binge , content (thebiblebinge),"1,797",,,523,May 2019,"The Bible Binge is a year old and in that time, we‚Äôve had an incredible time rediscovering stories and characters within the Bible. One thing we‚Äôve noticed is we have the desire to extend those conversations in ways our episodes just don‚Äôt allow. Which is why we wanted to start this community.

To be sure, one of the biggest motivations behind The Bible Binge in the first place was because we felt like there were a lot of people like us: not academics or theologians, but yet super interested in talking about the Bible in a way that is less Bible Scholar and more every person. And our hunch was confirmed in the incredible community of listeners that's grown around the show.

This is why we're excited to unveil our plans to help widen the potential for that growing community.

Listen, we know that merging conversation and content about the Bible / faith elements with monetization can be TRICKY. Understanding that, we're actively running away from a tip jar structure that offers vague value beyond good vibes and digital high fives.

Therefore we want to make this community as simple as possible while obviously providing significant value in return for your support: One tier, at a set support amount of $5. And for those cash monies, you get the following:







Asking you for monies is something we take very seriously. We know it‚Äôs no small thing to commit your financial resources to us and we deeply respect even your consideration of such a thing. But know that our commitment to you and this community is always to pursue a return on investment that greatly exceeds $5 each month."

This incredible disparity of value means that a loyal group of only a few thousand Patrons and Website Crew Members is as financially valuable as having a whole new YouTube channel with millions of subscribers.



Now consider, while YouTube is an amazing platform where we will always have certain shows, the bottom line of all free-to-watch, ad-based video platforms is that they inherently allow only content that is suitable for that model: low-cost, high-minute shows that appeal to an extremely broad mainstream audience and evermore restrictive ‚Äúbrand-friendly‚Äù guidelines.

The reason I've made this account where people can throw money at me is for two reasons:
1. I want to be able to pay the people who help me make my videos, especially the TTS-Videos.
These people help me just out of kindness and helpfulness and I always feel bad about pestering them about something I need for a video when I am the only one really benefiting from it. That's why I'd like to get a hold of some kind of budget so I can at least pay the people who help me for lunch or whatever! These people include voice-actors, artists, audio-makers and script-writers; they're all super awesome people and I feel they deserve something for what they do, thing is that I can't reward them myself.

2. I pay for programs each month (such as Adobe After Effects) to keep my channel up and running. Basically, it'd be absolutely fantastic if I could get alittle bit of help with this as I am but a poor hobo!

All in all, I want to follow through with the TTS-Series until its final episode. I want to keep producing material for you to enjoy and I'd hate to see it stop being made because of financial reasons.
So, even if it feels like I'm begging (which I feel awful about doing), I'm just going to try and ask if you can throw some dosh at me if you like my videos and would like to see the series until its very end!

This will help me stay afloat and will allow me to sit around and edit videos for a prolonged period of time; as long as you are around, I will stay here and make content for you!"

The Bible for Normal People is part of a discussion Pete and Jared have been having for years: how can everyday people get access to the best Bible teachers around and have a place to talk about it with a group of others as we take this journey of faith.

How can we invite more and more people into conversation about what the Bible is and what we should do with it? And so The Bible For Normal People was born - first as a podcast, and now a platform with books, courses, and this Patreon Community.

What Are We Trying to Do?
Our dream is to keep growing this community by inviting more and more people into the conversation, both through the podcast but also through book studies, online discussion groups, a video library, and more. But we need your help!

By supporting us at any level here on Patreon you not only get access to this growing community but you are also helping us expand our reach so others can join. We will be able to produce more content, create an online community, host and facilitate a lot more discussions with all of you, upgrade our technology, and much more.


What do you get out of helping us? There are a lot of tiers to choose from and we hope you will enjoy them! See below for details but to summarize, there are opportunities for exclusive patron-only content including videos and outtakes from the show, closed discussion groups, online hangouts and book studies with Pete & Jared, and even a chance to help us produce the show!"

What Is an Inner Field Trip?
Designed for Highly Sensitive People and Deep Feelers, the Inner Field Trip is a way to explore your unconscious and implicit biases using a combination of guided prompts and stream-of-consciousness writing.

Not everyone can go to marches, attend sit-ins, or engage in protests. Some aren't able to do so due to a disability. Others are not able to do so due to distance. Yet others are not able to do so because their nervous system gets over-stimulated. Due to these reasons, some simply stop engaging in social justice movements and use their sensitivities as an excuse as to why they just cannot.

The Inner Field Trip is designed to give those who identify as gentle, quiet, and highly sensitive a sense of renewed purpose. Instead of using your sensitivities as a reason to withdraw and hide, the Inner Field Trip gives you tools on how to create a sustainable and consistent practice around reclaiming your sensitivities so you use your privilege to stand with (not for) marginalized people.

About 3-4 times per year. They are typically hosted around the solstices and equinoxes (we host the winter one in January, and not around the December solstice, to honour the new year commitment many make at the beginning of the year). . To discover when we depart, check the header above.

We do work to integrate what you've discovered using virtual gatherings hosted by . Since many patrons are the only person in their circle doing this work, the community here on Patreon is a place where they can find support as they nurture their new identity. 

Your continued support as a patron in this community helps Leesa remain independent. That way, she can design new prompts and produce docushorts without having to go through anyone's editorial process where her words and message could be sanitized. 

Calling herself a , Leesa Ren√©e Hall is a highly sensitive and introverted anti-bias facilitator. After  to decolonize and deconstruct the narrative she was led to believe around her social and biological identities, Leesa takes  and through the very same process so they can protect their energy, stand on the side of justice, and become better ancestors.

While going on an Inner Field Trip isn't about the destination, you'll be guided through the journey by someone who went through the process herself.

By supporting me here on Patreon you contribute in a very substantial way towards making sure I can keep drawing erotic illustrations for a living, which I'm really grateful for and I hope is valuable to you!

As a thank you for helping me do what I do, I will send you rewards each month, like 5K resolution versions of illustrations, work-in-progress image series, time lapse videos and fully layered PSD files! You also get to vote on which illustration I make next!

I'm hoping this change helps make it an easy decision to support my work.

I will typically only make one illustration each month. That's usually all I have time for. But I leave the option open for doing two each month if I ever manage it. Because the amount of content I produce each month can potentially vary, you support me per illustration I post instead of per month or per week. This helps make sure you know what your support gets you!




My favorite things to draw and paint are happy people having a good time and enjoying each other. And fantasy themes with elves, nymphs, demon girls, etc. are very common in my work. Expect lots of goop, sometimes with alternate versions for those of you who aren't into that. And mainly original characters and content. Erotic fan art is cool, but developing my own stuff seems more fun! I have a cast of recurring characters that occasionally show up in illustrations, so keep an eye out for them!

Nope! If you just wanna see people getting it on, you don't have to pay for it. But I can't keep making these pictures without support, and I'm hoping the rewards I offer help make supporting me worthwhile. :)

DesireSFM , SFM NSFW animation (desiresfm),"1,725",,,1513,Aug 2016,"The great strength of videogame-porn is, that we as the viewer bring in our relationship to a character, we developed as a gamer before. Lara Croft is not just a fine eyecatcher, but also a character some of us know for more than 20 years. Yennefer or Miranda are more than some gorgeous looking black haired beauties, they were the love interests of our Geralts and Shepards, we spent so much playtime with. We know those characters, feel for them, know their story! Something a regular porn actor or actress can't achive, no matter how good they are acting or looking.
As a SFM-Artist I'll try my best to wake those emotions in you. That's why I am focussing on story, setting and visual language in my videos. I have no interest in just random model-combinations in 3-seconds-loops. Instead I'll try to be as lore-friendly as possible and pick up plot lines from the games to maximise the atmosphere in my videos and let them tell their own story. 
The internet is for porn, but this porn-blog is for gamers!

What you can expect:
Most of my work focuses on clips with a runtime between 2 to 10 minutes. I'll animate regular & futa-sex. My work mostly is dark themed, telling stories about treason, forbidden affairs, self-abandonment and distress. But always making sure, that all parties, involved in the sex, are enjoying it.

If you agree with my vision for gaming-porn, I would be really thankful, if you would consider to support me here on patreon.

It's important to note that you really don't have to and it's entirely optional. Nowadays, I will be fine with the money I make off YouTube unless something drastic happens and I would much rather you look out for yourself and your loved ones! If you still want to throw a few bucks my way then feel free, just please don't let it negatively affect you. 

If you do decide to support me on here, I highly recommend you join the monthly livestreams. If you can make it to them I would love to see you there. We always have a very chill chat and game session :)

As of the recent patreon update there is a problem with the sign up form that auto selects a $5 teir. There is no $5 teir. Selecting this ""ghost"" teir when subscribing, updating or changing your patreon account will leave you locked out of the files unless you resubmit a change to a 12.50 slot. Sorry about this, we're seeing what can be done to fix it.


Welcome to the Makers Cult
Hi, we are a Matt, Seb and Will, a three-man team creating 3D printable miniatures for tabletop gaming. We mostly focus on the theme of gothic sci-fi, and our miniatures are perfect for use as wargaming alternatives. Through polls and our discord channel, we let our community direct us on what we make from month to month.

How does it work?
On the 4th of the month we release models through a ""download"" post. The download link on this post will only be available until the end of the month. During the month, we will post polls and show work-in-progress leading up to the following month. Our previous month's models will be downloadable individually from our CGTrader store if you are a late joiner.


By signing up for a month of the Makers Cult Patreon you will gain access to the current months models.
Each of us will propose a set each month. We are nerdy about wargaming, especially the variety and modularity. You can expect many options for vehicles and troops.

As we grow and meet goals, we will reward patrons with extra content on top of the standard monthly offerings.

We also have a that is available at all times with a variety of different models, a great taster set to show what we are capable of producing.


This is a preview image of the current models in the Welcome Pack.







If you are already a patron or interested in what we offer, we recommend joining our discord server, this is the home to our lovely community. On this discord you are free to socialise, share your prints, paint jobs, troubleshoot printing difficulties, and even share remixes of our designs in our patron exclusive channels!










Not only do we provide models for patreon but we also share many files for free on thingiverse too! We recommend checking out our collections if you have not already.






This is where you will find all our models from previous months








We all really appreciate your support and hope to make your time as a patreon an enjoyable experience. Cheers."

This form of harm reduction - which does not demonize substance use but instead showcases how to use them safely and responsibly - is the future of drug safety. You know why? Because it WORKS!

I have 3 kids, one being a 15 year old. I know first-hand how suggestible and easily influenced teenagers are. Just look at the fact they think they know EVERYTHING!

Instead of trying to pour shit in their cups, I divert their attention to my own nightmare stories of drug excursions gone sour (pun intended) This allows viewers to learn from my mess, without ever needing to clean up their own. This also allows me to showcase the importance of always testing your drugs with reagent kits - a simple act which is often the difference between life and death.

Anyway, If you like what I am doing then consider buying me the equivalent of a cup of coffee. Not only will you be helping me stay stimulated to create more videos, but if just 0.5% of my subscribers did this I could do youtube full-time into the foreseeable future.

Next version release approx. date: End of October/beginning of November

Some material we give as a reward is for adults only, you must be 18 or older to pledge.

Hi there! We are Knot games, a small team developing adult video games. Actually, we're working on our first video game, but we've divided it in chapters so there's a lot of playable content.

Why support us?

Without our patrons and their pledges we wouldn't be able to make it, also, because the more pledges we get, the more resources we can count on, this being either new artists, animators, programmers and musicians to help us develop the game faster and better, while allowing us to offer more rewards.

We value and take note of the feedback provided by our patrons, keeping in touch to help them solve their doubts, technical issues and asking for certain guidelines of the project and see which fit them the most.

In gratitude for your pledges and feedback, we offer a large range of rewards that grant access to making of content, pre-release images and animations, sketches, exclusive images, funny gifs and comics, polls to vote for certain characters and animations, access to discord server, also you'll gain access to all the previously published rewards until the date, and of course, our most sincere gratitude.




























In this first chapter of the story, Elana will discover the Spirit of Lust and become her champion. She will make some weird allies and influence the villagers to perform some spicy stuff with her while the fairy learns how control her powers and faces many foes.
This was the firs developed chapter, done during the 2016-2017. The art style is simple but friendly and lighthearted. This chapter contains 400 images, 50 animations and 450 events.





Chapter II represents the main core of the champion of lust's story. In this chapter, Elana will learn to switch her body type at her will, adopting a much more voluptuous form and unlocking new ways to influence the villagers. She'll have to learn the villager's tastes while defeating the soldiers of the Peace Guard, under Jane's command. Luckily for the fairy, she will meet new allies and craft new spirits, amulets and potions to aid her in her quest for lust. This chapter was developed during the 2017-2019. The art style of this chapter evolves, becoming much more defined and smooth but keeping its original lighthearted spirit. This chapter contains a whole new user interface, about 500 images, about 90 animations, about 500 events and 2 special cinematic.





Chapter III is the chapter that we are currently developing, the final chapter of the saga, where the key parts of the plot will be revealed while Elana will have to manage an academy of lust and find out her friends in a whole new set of worlds. This chapter is being developed with a new engine, bringing a new perspective, user interface and ways to interact with the world. In a ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù graphic adventure fashion the game includes a management part while keeping the soul of the previous two chapters. The development of this chapter started at 2019.






If you can't currently afford to pledge us but want to support the project; Share our work, Like and rate it! Spread the word, everything helps!

I create videos on engineering - not the kind that you find on TV (World's most impressive engineering feats!) - but the kind that provides useful knowledge for people looking to enter the engineering field or are just looking to brush up on their skills. Most of my videos cover topics in control system theory (hence the channel name), but I also like to talk about robotics and space systems too.  

Aside from videos, I'm writing a book called ""The Fundamentals of Control Theory"".  You can get the work-in-progress version of the book here: http://bit.ly/2XLlAKl

I hate expensive textbooks, therefore, I'm releasing the book under a Creative Commons license so that even if you don't want to support me (or don't have the money to), you can just get the book from the link above. The important thing is that the content I create can help as many people as possible.

For my supporters (per creation), a creation is a Control System Lecture video or a section update to my book .  At the moment I would love to produce one creation per month, but realistically, it's more like every 2 or 3 months.  Of course, that would all change if I meet my 2nd goal! I don't charge for announcements, blog type videos, or book releases that are just typo fixes.

Please review and understand your contributions.  I have a little write up here: 

I like creating content that everyone can access for free.  Your support means so much to me because it allows me to be able to get the equipment I need and one day have the financial freedom to make this my full-time job.  Cheers!"

My name is SovietWomble. And I have hands. And with these hands I make Youtube videos, which I then place on the internet.

What are these Youtube videos?
Well in 2013 I tried the DayZ mod for Arma 2. During which, my life was saved by a colossal idiot called ZF Cyanide. He flew me, by helicopter, into the northern forests to give me a blood bag and a rifle. I didn't know it at the time, but his original plan was to molest me, shoot me, then steal my stuff. But I successfully charmed him with my silky, smooth British accent and I was introduced to the rest of the Zero Fucks clan. 

The original purpose of the Youtube videos were as a recruitment tool for both clan and DayZ server. And just general fun. But it turns out they're actually quite fun to make. So even after we'd moved on from the dayz server, I continued to make compilations of the various moments of silly that happen as the ZF clan play

Why donate?
In February 2016, thanks to your generosity, I realized I'd be able to take a stab at doing this full time. So I now work 8 hours a day on Youtube editing.

So any donations through Patreon keep me alive; pay my rent and buy me food & water (which I converted into Youtube videos and excrement in a 3/1 ratio). , and I'm not greedy, so please only donate if you enjoy my work and simply feel like tipping me to show appreciation. And thank you :)"

I think music is a magical thing. It has comforted and healed and inspired me throughout my life, and that is what I hope to do for others with the music I create. I want to connect with people and help them feel less alone (and I want them to help me feel less alone, too!). I want to bring hope and happiness to peoples lives. I want to help people feel. If this is something you believe in, something that feels important to you in some way, then this is the place where you get to be a part of all of that.

During my last 10 or so years of being a full-time musician I have learned time and time again that the only thing I needed was my listeners. You. Some of you have been with me since the Crash The Super Bowl days, when I won a major label contract, entirely because of YOU. Some of you have been with me since I left said label, started a street team, and went independent, because I had YOU. I have toured, recorded albums, made hundreds of videos‚Ä¶ all because of YOU. In recent years, through the support of individual patrons, I began getting paid for the videos I was putting out into the world for the first time in history. You, You, You.

YOU are the ones that believe in me and my music, the ones that support the creation of my music, the ones that allow me to do what I love everyday, the ones that give me purpose and joy, knowing that there are humans listening on the other side of all of this, and as such, YOU deserve the credit. And that's why I've decided that from now on, my patrons = my label. You, my listeners, my fans, my Kinerds, will be my actual label. But it's so much more than that, too. KG Records is my community, my family, my people, my support network. 

Quick, and very important aside, though: You are all equally important to me when it comes to my music. My music has purpose because you LISTEN. Because I get to connect with real live humans out there in the world. So if supporting me in this way is not possible or appealing to you, that's fine! My videos will always be available to you for free, my songs will always be released in all the usual places. (And if you can't afford to buy my music, steal it. Seriously.) My ultimate goal has always been to make the best music I can and to share it with as many people as possible. 

Thank you for believing in me and my music. Thank you for making my art possible. Thank you for being my online family, my support team, my beloved Kinerds, and now, my label. Let's go make magic together.

Ok now a bit about us:
Danüá®üá¶and I (Kika)üá≠üáπmade the decision to not buy a couch! Instead, we moved out of the scripted city life and started living‚Ä¶ differently!

Our life at sea began with an old sailboat (1972 Pearson 36)in a parking lotBut, with the sweat of our brows and the strength of our backs, we refitted her top to bottom and even built our own electric motor. One step at a time, we are exploring, learning, and sharing the beauties of the world so that we can one day use our knowledge and skills to give back to those who need a helping hand.

We would love to have you be part of our crazy journey as we sail across the great sea and explore what the world has to offer. We work hard to produce the very best videos we can, and your pledge on Patreon helps us make it all happen.

Charge up front is enabled on this Patreon, which means that you will be charged as soon as you pledge.

I make Abdl Art and comics and hope to find time for game development. All characters here are portrayed as mature (18+) version of themselves.

I want to come up with a good compromise between financial security and interesting rewards for you, that would allow me to continue projects in progress (like Perpetual Change) and offer new things (more Fan Art, Comics, and games once Perpetual Change is done.)




The first of each month, I do a ""Fan Art"" post for 3$ Patreons where they can suggest the character they'd like to see. After that, the first 40 suggestions of the post are made into two polls where Patreons can vote for their favorites. Fan Art are usually cell-shaded pictures.

If I have the time, exceptionally, I can choose one character who didn't get much love in the poll but whose design I like. It will be the surprise of the month.

Expect between 8 and 9 Fan Art a month.




There should be 4 comic pages a month, 2 for each comic I'm currently working on.

There also going to be 1 picture of a caption story each month. 

I'm not a native English speaker, so mistakes might occur in the writing, I'll correct them as soon you'll point them out to me.




Every week, I do a report on the game I'm currently working on and every first of the month, you get a demo of the game!




The last day of each month, I'll do a special livestream where Patreons can suggest anything they want. I'll be drawing the suggestions for 9 to 10 hours straight. 



I'm doing work cycles of 5 months each. After a work cycle, I take a month to rest and prepare next projects.

Lena and Ian are two very different people who find themselves in a very similar moment in their lives. Both struggling to achieve their dreams, both hurting because of love.
Their lives will become intertwined, with each other and with several characters that will impact who they are and who they will become.
They will be able to experience the heights of love or the depths of lust, friendship or betrayal, moral or immoral, success or failure... And you will be the one to choose. But one's choices can often tangle together and lead to an unexpected mess, so be mindful, for you thread the thread of their.











You play as Ashley and make choices that will affect her story in a meaningful way. Are you a good girl or a bad one? Will you stay in the right path or deviate and fall prey to the temptations you'll find in your way? Whatever you choose, it will lead to interesting, exciting and vastly different outcomes.
This game aims to present you a complex and branching storyline, coherent characters and a lot of freedom, with meaningful choice mechanics and hand drawn illustrations different form the usual 3D models. And a lot of kinky scenes and situations!

StarTalk Radio , Space & Science Podcasts & Videos (startalkradio),"1,635",,,2002,Apr 2015,"Message from Neil deGrasse Tyson

StarTalk¬Æ began as a dream. An idea that we could blend Science, Comedy, & Pop Culture and deliver it to the public in a commercially viable way. We did not want to be bound to a model, in which funds must be raised seasonally to operate. But we learned quickly that our show concept was so different from anything else in the marketplace that no sponsors were interested.

Proceeding with the courage of our vision, we applied for a grant from the National Science Foundation to test the concept. They approved a multi-year grant for this experiment. After some follow-up ""bridge"" support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we finally broke even in 2014. Today, StarTalk supports a free-lance staff of nearly two-dozen people, and our branded show and show snippets appear as Podcasts, YouTube videos, SiriusXM broadcasts, and as a TV show on the NatGeo Channel, we‚Äôve been Emmy-nominated four times for Outstanding Informational Programming.

All good news. But what we learned along the way is that the marketplace of sponsors is risk-averse. In retrospect, no surprise, But we still generate active, creative ideas on how to grow our reach further -- on different platforms, with different demographics, in different media, using variations of our show model, and so forth. In nearly all those untested pathways, no sponsor awaits us.

So we create this page, humbly asking your support of our ongoing experiments in bringing the Universe down to Earth.

Respectfully Submitted,
Neil deGrasse Tyson, Astrophysicist
Host and Executive Producer of StarTalk"

Introduction-
Hello! My name is Fluff-Kevlar, and I draw mostly adult/NSFW anthro/furry artwork, but you will see both non-adult and non-furry here too. I try to put quality over quantity, and I work very hard to make a variety of high-quality art for you, my supporters!

Goal of this Patreon-
Most of my work in the past had been on nothing but individual commissions and paysite pinups. I started this page as a means to fund artwork that might not otherwise ever be drawn; I'd have to wait for someone to commission it, or squeeze in the time myself with no income for it and hope it made money later. Things like pinups, streams, tutorials, and comics.

I dislike pay-walls; almost everything here will be shared later, in my galleries, at lower resolutions. However, patrons see this work earlier, get to vote and give feedback, see any alternate versions, in , and stream benefits as my only way of saying ""thank you"" without turning my Patreon into locked content. This isn't a store, you're my work, and I only ask you pledge what you think my work is worth! I will do my best to make it worthwhile. Every dollar counts, and every patron is equally important to me, since I know people change tiers all the time."

I'm Jack Slack, a writer for Vice's Fightland and the host of the Fights Gone By podcast wherein we discuss the technical ins and outs of the beautiful business of fighting. Having written about professional MMA, boxing and kickboxing fights as well as martial arts history and terrible eighties action movies for the best part of five years, I decided to make the jump into podcasting.

On the Fights Gone By podcast we discuss the technical and strategic points of fighting and how the habits of two men can impact the outcome of a fight We examine topics such as the role of reach, the taking of dominant angles, the importance of timing and feinting, and everything else which plays a role in how the fights actually go. We also talk about all of the silly bollocks that goes on in this circus of a sport behind the scenes and between the fights.

I've spent most of my writing career working for big companies but I would like to keep my podcast independent. I can only do that, however, through the help of my readers and listeners! It is my desire to keep the Fights Gone By podcast open to everyone but Patreon bois will get extra content - extra articles, episodes, history lectures."

I started writing more than 18 years ago and have been doing it ever since. I‚Äôve written more than 2 million words and spent thousands of hours on the writing alone.

Yes, it was. I‚Äôve written more than 25 books in the saga, and the first 20 were free. I wish I could continue posting free stories and still make a living as an author, but that simply isn‚Äôt realistic.

I work very hard to produce a quality product (the story and everything else here), and I want to get paid for my work. Wouldn‚Äôt you? This is my job, after all.

So, all the books and stories after will be pay-only. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll eventually publish the SC Epilogue for free, so you can learn who dies and who‚Äôs the wife."

Kincaid is a lewd metroidvania-style platformer with a sci-fi theme. Our protagonist is an archeologist, exploring uncharted planets and their wild life!

Join our playful and naughty wolf girl Kincaid, as she sexplores flora & fauna and meets new friends (with benefits~) and adversaries!

Kincaid is not alone: She is joined by her sidekick Ai, an artificial intelligence that lives inside her ship's computer and provides support from the orbit.

An exciting adventure full of hot action, burning lust and erotic surprises unfolds!






Kincaid is a naughty wolf girl and quickly succumbs to sexy distractions. Give her a nudge to remind her of her quest - or do nothing and watch her satisfy her curiosity and lust!

She writes down all her ""research findings"" (unlocked scenes) in her journal for you to enjoy again at a later time.

The action focuses on a female protagonist facing male and female opponents, as well as some more exotic encounters and monsters.





That's me! I'm an artist and game developer within the furry fandom. If you know me, it's probably because of my porn on  ! I create all the art for Kincaid, as well as designing the gameplay and world together with Nullbunny.


Hey, I'm Null and I'm responsible for most of the coding work! I started making video games at a young age and it's been my number one hobby ever since. I'm also working on Hunt and Snare, an adult furry hunting game. My dream is to make a game completely by myself one day.


 
Null and I have been working together on games for 6 years now. We know each others processes and we have an efficient workflow going. We're also living together, which makes it even easier to communicate and collaborate.

We love making games and will work on Kincaid no matter what. By pledging you can encourage and appreciate our work, and enjoy some exclusive rewards!

With your support we'll be able to dedicate more of our time creating Kincaid, instead of spending most of our time on freelance work and doing commissions.

In the long run we hope that Patreon will help us get other artists on board as well and make Kincaid the best erotic furry platformer.

If you ever took pleasure in any of my books, radio, stage shows and ‚Äì this is a long shot ‚Äì my TV work, then I think you find the stuff here within as a nourishing balm, as enriching succour. (See? I can write like the blazes when pushed)

After years of going off in all directions like a Catherine Wheel this venture intends to put everything under one roof. I will be placing all writings, videos, broadcasts, pictures, archive, reviews, recipes, observations, collaborations, diaries, jokes and merchandise here for The Ages. True, there will be precious few recipes but the rhythm that simple added word brought to the list of available treasures works perfectly.

I turned 63 last week. Let‚Äôs face it if I‚Äôm lucky, I may have only seventy or eighty summers left in which to churn out (curate) all this stuff. So I‚Äôm going to make it good. Not like some of these deals I‚Äôve seen around here where for your hard earned do-re-mi you get some intermittent threadbare ‚Äòcontent‚Äô that if it were seaside rock would have the word ‚ÄòSUCKER‚Äô written all the way through it.

I will be at this and adding virtually everyday. There will be plenty to read, hear and watch. Don‚Äôt believe me? Then ask anyone who has attended the live shows. I only deal in LONG shrift. And the quality goes in before the name goes on.

Very Bad Wizards , a Biweekly Podcast (verybadwizards),"1,599","$3,388 per episode",$2.12 per episode,1617,May 2016,"Very Bad Wizards is a collaboration between Tamler Sommers, a philosopher at the University of Houston, and David Pizarro, a psychologist at Cornell University. We first met at a conference on ethics about 10 years ago, and have been arguing (and occasionally agreeing) about morality ever since, often over drinks. At some point we realized that our conversations were entertaining and repugnant enough that other people might enjoy eavesdropping. We were both big fans of podcasts and decided to start our own.

The title of our podcast is sampled from the title of one of Tamler's books A Very Bad Wizard: Morality Behind the Curtain (a title he stole from an obscure movie about a wizard). David creates most of the music--you can see our original soundtrack here.

For the last four years we‚Äôve had a blast arguing about Kant, gender, emotions, religion, free will, revenge, blame, honor, restorative justice, artificial intelligence, porn, death, moral objectivity, Straw Dogs, comedy, Mr. Robot, and much more. Every so often we‚Äôll even have a special guest to lend some respectability to the show. We have a fantastic intelligent group of listeners from all over the world who aren‚Äôt shy about telling us when we‚Äôre wrong. We love interacting with them on Facebook, twitter, and email.

It‚Äôs been a labor of love but it has been a lot of labor. For every episode we put in hours upon hours of work recording, editing, preparing, and producing the podcast. We also have plenty of expenses, from equipment to hosting fees, which keep growing along with our audience. Thanks to Patreon, if you‚Äôre a fan of the podcast you can help support some of this work by pledging a certain amount per episode. We appreciate all levels of support! We hope to keep doing this podcast for a long time.

Repugnantly yours,

Thanks for stopping by my page!
""My name Jeff!""

Born in the late 70's, my childhood can be described pretty easily..  Sci-fi and horror movies and TV and comics Marvel, Starwars... Robocop, Arnie movies ... Alien,  The A Team... Labyrinth, the Dark Crystal... Short Circuit... Buck Rogers, Battlestar Galactica, Tron... so many they just can't be listed...

The easiest way to check out what models are available and what people are doing with them is by visiting the facebook group. We have a great community growing and for me its a lot easier to interact with patreons and updates to facebook pages are much less intrusive than a tonne of email notifications.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/333491834120262/

FAQ
How Long have you been on Patreon?
Currently there is 3 years worth of releases here and gigabytes of models now.  I was on Thingiverse almost since it started and all the free models in that time I released can be found here:https://www.thingiverse.com/Geoffro/


Everything! no really, as much stuff as I can possibly make. From cosplay, busts, miniatures, scale figures, sci-fi, 80's movies memorabilia, Add-ons for 1:12 black series and 1:6 scale Hot toys figures... the list  is long and if it hasn't been done, if you ask for it, it will most likely get made.

Are you an 80's kid looking to print something from your old favorite TV show or movie? Well, there's that and more, so this may be the place for you!


You receive a starter pack with a heap of models, including a fully printable suit, busts, helmets and props - and of course all that months releases and so on.
you are granted access to the archive where all previous models from the past 3.5 years are stored and you will be able to download them all.


As soon as you sign up you will be charged for the amount dependent on the tier you choose, and after that you will be billed at the beginning of each month. You are welcome to sign up for multiple Tiers (when they are made available etc) This subscription is pay-when-you-sign-up because you instantly receive access to so many files and believe it or not, people do try and cheat the system.

(this one gets asked a lot..)

Short Answer, No, sorry. Access to all the old files is a member benefit for staying subscribed for 3 patreon cycles and hanging around.


Deleting your subscription deletes your server download access. Once you unsubscribe access to the download archive ceases and you will be billed at the start of the next month.


Yes - and I DO NOT ask for  additional funds or royalties for people to sell prints.

Altos and Herdone , Adult Games (altosandherdone),"1,586",,,642,Jan 2019,"Hi there! We are Altos and Herdone and we are making The Headmaster, a dark comedy combining a nonlinear story, stats management and a unique punishment system.

About the Game
In the not too distant future, on a small island nation, a crisis has arisen. The number of students graduating from school has fallen sharply and university places are going unfilled. Faced with the prospect of mass unemployment and potential economic disaster the government is forced to introduce emergency measures. All students over eighteen who failed or were expelled from school are to be forced back into education at a number of special facilities.

In The Headmaster you play an expert in young adult psychology with some unique ideas about how to tackle the crisis. After a demonstration of your theories at a teachers conference, you are approached by the agent of a mysterious organisation. He invites you to interview for the position of headmaster (principal) at one of the newly founded facilities for over eighteen-year-olds. Keen to prove yourself and your theories you gladly accept.

N.B. All characters portrayed in this game are over the age of eighteen. All acts protracted in this game are between fictional consenting adults.






This game is released for free and is funded entirely through the support of our patrons. Without that support, we wouldn't be able to spend as much time on the game. If you like what we're doing and want to see more then spare us a dollar or whatever you can afford.

If you can spare more then we also offer rewards for our higher-tier patrons. Those who donate $5 or more per month will get updates on the game's development and will get access to the game one month before the public release. Those who donate $10 or more per month will get image previews for upcoming releases, will be able to participate in beta testing and will be able to take part in polls on which girls or storylines will be the focus of future updates. They will also get access to the Teachers Lounge section of the Discord where I discus future content ideas.  Those who donate $20 or more a month will get access to exclusive artwork and HD wallpapers not found in the game, plus they will be able to access the Headmasters Study section of the Discord where I post a selection of custom art requests each month.

It's a slice of life comic about superheroines, focusing not so much on superhero battles (though that does happen), but on characters, humor, having fun with the genre tropes and sometimes I slip in a pop-culture reference here or there.

Thanks to everyone's support, the comic now updates on Mondays and Thursdays! Being a full color comic page instead of a 4 panel strip means they take a lot of time to create, so I'm pretty tapped out at two a week, but who knows, maybe one day I can bump it up to 3 a week or maybe even do a Grrl Power After Dark spinoff. The ultimate goal of course is to trade my car in for a flying solid gold palanquin while being waited on by a plethora of pi√±atas, I mean... tanned attendants, but one step at a time.

Saw the private podcast and was VERY skeptical of it. Then I saw like 10+ people endorsing it in your comments, and I was like hmm maybe its legit.

For a while now PATREON as a PLATFORM hasn‚Äôt been meeting my needs in what I want to achieve and do with my content these days. If you have been around for a while now I know you know EXACTLY WHAT I‚ÄôM TALKING ABOUT hahaha.
Patreon for a long time has had issues in the backend that has often really affected what we are trying to do here. We have had multiple conversations with Patreon over the years and it seems as if they too are moving in a direction that best works for them. ALAS it is a direction that does not work with myself and what i want to do.
Now this is not to say goodbye, this is just to say see you later! Hopefully things in the future will become a little more cohesive with the patreon/creator/supporter user interface and we will be able to come back SWINGING <3 FYUHCK YEAH.
Seeing as we will be saying ‚ÄúLater DUDE‚Äù to PATREON TEMPORARILY, we figure LET‚ÄôS GO OUT WITH A BANG!

None of this would be possible without the support and feedback of my patrons, and I can't possibly thank you all enough. Seriously. Thank you all. 

The Company will always be a free game, with the latest public version available both here and at my. Patrons will receive early access to releases, as well as regular development blogs at least once a week. 

Thank you all for your interest and support!



A: The Company primary focuses on gender transformation, mind control, and corruption. A detailed content advisory can be found at The Company's .


A: The Company is currently expected to run a total of 5 chapters to reach the conclusion of its main storyline. Once you reach the end, you'll receive an ending based on the various choices you've made and the current state of the game. Since you won't be able to do everything there is to do in a single playthrough, multiple playthroughs are encouraged!


A: While certain elements of the game are central to the story, mind control and corruption, in particular, the majority of content is indeed avoidable.


A: Yes.


A: Nope! All scenes in the game will adjust to your gender, and you won't miss out on any of them regardless of what gender you choose to play as.


A: The MCS-X serums are designed to trigger life-changing effects for the characters you give them to, effectively acting as ""Bad Ends"" for those characters. You were given plenty of warning and you should have known your actions would have consequences. You monster.


A: Characters can get pregnant in the game, as can the player! Due to the short length of the main story (Approximately 4-5 months of ingame time) there is no kind of birthing content. Instead, pregnancy will factor into the ending you receive, which will take the form of an epilogue some months after the conclusion.


A: I am commissioning artwork in parallel with the game's development with the intention of eventually making it the ""official"" media choice for the game. The current media style isn't going anywhere and will continue to receive priority development until the game's completion. This is being done to give me more complete ownership of the game in terms of marketability, creativity, and continuity. The current media offerings will always be an option.


A: Sure are! You'll need to enter them into the Additional Notes field when you're starting a new game. You can enter more than one by separating them with a space, and they are not case sensitive. Find a complete list of cheats , at the bottom of the page."

David Firth , SALAD FINGERS + other bits of insanity and weirdness. (davidfirth),"1,524",,,1289,Mar 2017,"Who am I?

Hey chaps, David Firth here. You may know me as the person who makes Salad Fingers but I do loads of other stuff too. Look, I made a bullet pointed list:

ANIMATION: Salad Fingers, Burnt Face Man, Jerry Jackson, Health Reminder, Sock, Spoilsbury Toast Boy, Dog Of Man etc.
VIDEO: Devvo, The News Hasn't Happened Yet, that dubbed Michael Jackson one where he's chasing the woman....etc. 
MUSIC: I am Locust Toybox mainly, but I occasionally do side projects.
AUDIO COMEDY PODCAST: WallerFM is a comedy podcast I make with Christian Webb. It's mainly sketch comedy / satire.
ARTWORK: I make art. It's all over my wall. I sometimes add it to my animations but otherwise it's just to be looked at.
WRITING: I write all my videos and animations and stuff but I am also working on stuff that is intended to be read, rather than turned into a script.



I've been putting stuff online since the late '90s. Back then my goal was to be on TV. I wanted to be the next South Park or something. Eventually I had meetings with TV people and found out it's all a load of bullcrap and South Park is one in a million. Everyone else on TV does as they are told and there is no place for free expression. So like most animators I make stuff exclusively online, where it's pretty much uncensored. It doesn't matter where it ends up - all that matters is that I can do it without being watered down by advertisers or people who think they know best. 



The problem is that it doesn't pay the bills. This stuff is all really hard work. Youtube ads are a small help, but unless you are putting multiple vids a week, they pay very little. An average project takes WEEKS to MONTHS of solid work, yet roughly makes around $1 per 1000 views in ad revenue. That isn't much, especially as Youtube doesn't tend to feature much animation since the ""viewer engagement"" doesn't typically reach their standards. To make a living from Youtube revenue I would have to really start cutting corners and making broader stuff to get more views. That is not my style.

Worse still, in efforts to appease more advertisers, Youtube have started removing monetization from anything that may be remotely shocking or offensive to anyone. This seems to include satire and jokes as well as cartoon violence, all of which feature prominently in my works. I would never compromise this for advertisers. When I first started putting stuff online the sense of freedom of expression was exciting. These days it is starting to look a bit like daytime TV with some Orwell thrown in.

It'd just be nice to just keep putting stuff out the way I want, for the people that want to see it. I don't want to have to change the content to make it more appealing to wide audiences. That's how creativity dies.



This is where you chaps come in. After all this time, many of you have stuck around, and many more have climbed aboard, even though I haven't released much recently. I applaud the patience of my fans and followers. I never stopped creating, I just strive to continuously do new things, bigger and better and it takes a long time. I have so many projects running and I know they'll all get done. I just need a bit of support. If you could throw me a few Pounds, Dollars, Euros, Yen or Aussiecoins then my stuff will continue to appear before your eyes. Developing in to unknown worlds of creativity and sillyness rather than being sucked dry by the banal machine. And if I fail to deliver the goods then you can retract your happy pennies and spend them on bubblegum. Does it sound like a deal? Yes it does."

I skrivande stund (november 2019) har vi runt (25 000-30 000) lyssningar per program,  det vill s√§ga en f√∂rdubbling sedan vintern och v√•ren 2016. Nu siktar vi p√• n√§sta m√•l - 50 000 lyssningar per program. F√∂r detta kr√§vs att vi hittar former f√∂r att professionalisera driften, kanske ta in en redakt√∂r eller personer som kan marknadsf√∂ra AMK till fler.

AMK Morgon finansieras till 90% av lyssnare som sk√§nker en liten slant varje m√•nad.

Resten finansieras av sponsorer.

Patrons √§r d√§rf√∂r l√•ngt viktigare √§n n√•gon sponsor n√•gonsin kommer att bli.

Ahoy , Video Game Documentaries (ahoy),"1,521","$2,496 per month",$1.64 per month,1523,Aug 2016,"Hello! My name is Stuart Brown - best known for my YouTube channel, 'Ahoy'.

I produce documentary-style video content about video games and their impact on culture: history, influence and artefacts of design. As a one man team, I'm responsible for all aspects of production: script-writing, graphics, voiceover, gameplay recording, editing and music.

I've been doing this for a while now - and so far I've been reliant on advertising revenue: an inefficient but passive way to monetise that works very well for some channels - but less so for mine.

I've always been reluctant to make demands of my audience - not once have I implored anyone to like, comment, or subscribe - and it is with the same reluctance that I seek crowdfunding. What changed my mind was the realisation that as a creator, ALL my income must ultimately derive from my audience - who else?


I'd like to carry on doing what I do best, and with your help - I can.

In exchange for your support, I will pledge the following:



Lastly, I'd like to thank all of you for your support over the years - whether through donations, your kind words or just silent attention. Ultimately, you are the reason I do this - the motivation that fuels my quest to make the best video game content possible.

There's no shortage of gaming videos on YouTube - but nobody makes content quite like mine."

You can find quick links to relevant information, as well as browse my entire back catalogue (including free stuff) on the Notice Board. If there is anything that is not covered there, please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.

About my Patreon
It is my hope that these maps will go beyond providing a backdrop to your encounters. They will also help tell your story, provide inspiration for detailed world building and give your players that ever so important feeling of verisimilitude and immersion. Each map set covers multiple levels or areas of a building, dungeon, or environment, creating a real sense of exploration and dynamic gameplay.


New map set uploads are weekly (up to 4x per month), so there will always be something new for your upcoming session. Depending on your tier, you will also get additional bonus material throughout the month that is not charged for. You can find out more about specific tier rewards 

When you sign up, you will not only receive all new creations going forwards, but you will also have access to the complete archive. All content beyond that is free bonus material.


I upload free lo-res (72DPI) versions of each map set every week, so you can see if you like my maps before opting to pledge, or just use the free versions for you campaign. If you choose to use the free maps, but would still like to help support me, I have a Ko Fi page 


If you would prefer to buy my map sets or asset packs as a one off payment, rather than pledging on Patreon, I have a Roll20 Marketplace store . All creations have the option to download as well as be used in the application. Maps and asset packs will be uploaded to Roll20 on an 8-10 week delay after being released on Patreon, and Patrons will always receive the artworks at a discounted price.

Every month, a $5 donation will get you access to THREE bonus episodes. And these bonuses aren't just ""hey, here's kinda something like the main show, enjoy."" We've done lots of bonus episode types over the course of our Patreon so far: episodes where Stefan dives into his personal blocks, video episodes where John imitates online fast-food reviews or opens a bunch of Funko Pops, a look at awful Fiverr accounts, trivia games, and our most popular bonus episodes: Word Up!, where we take a look at the worst of the cursed celebrity shout-out website Cameo [dot] com. We aren't gonna waste your time.  We put in a ton of effort to make our bonus episodes unique and different and worth your money, and we usually bring some fantastic guests along for the ride with us.

And we're coming up with new bonus episode types all the time. Maybe we'll do one about video games, or music, or the holidays, or how John truthfully got beat up a lot in elementary school by the non-gifted kids. It's whatever. The point is, you're gonna get lots of great bonus content. And if you're dumb enough to give us $100, you can tell us what to do for an episode. A true honour. 

? Seems weird, since you're donating to a podcast. But if you'd rather read than listen (nerd), we also have a , which will get you one newsletter from Stefan and one newsletter from John each month, , you get ""Guest Letters"" where we have writers, friends of the show, and even some listeners write a newsletter, just for you. You get 5 things to read every month, plus you're helping freelancers get paid. It's a good thing. For $4/month, if you think written content is king, you can just snag those newsletters. For $8, you can get both the bonus episodes AND newsletter content, because we want your bucket of content to remain ever full. Or whatever. Pick a better metaphor if you hated reading that as much as I hated typing it.

Because that call has been so clear and nearly universal, I feel compelled, though the dust is far from settled at Evergreen, to move forward on this platform, despite the fact that it‚Äôs bound to be a little rough at first. I will be posting videos on YouTube, and writing on Medium.

Here‚Äôs what you can expect:

The Evergreen story is the tip of a very large and important iceberg. I am quickly going to move off of the details of Evergreen‚Äôs absurd descent into madness, and shift to discussing the larger implications for academic institutions, and the breakdown in discourse across civilization that it mirrors. 

Many are also telling me that you want to hear deep, evolutionary analysis. My wife and I have been hearing from students for 15 years that this material must be brought into public view, because it is transformative. I don‚Äôt believe in fate, but I am a huge fan of serendipity. If you want to know why living things, including humans, are structured as they are and behave the way that they do: Stay tuned.

You two went through a break up
It's been fifteen years since then and you've gone to multiple different rehab programs. Now that you're clean of drugs, You decided to start dating Emily once again. You've been dating her online for many months now and your relationship is blossoming. She's taken a new liking to you and believes you two can restore things to the way they used to be. You live in different states, but it's summer time and you've decided to visit Emily in Ohio. The game begins when you first meet her in a bar.

I know this line has lost it's meaning because of Telltale games, in one way or another. I guarantee, you will not encounter every scene in the game on your first playthrough without some  which I do encourage. The actual gameplay comes down to just making decisions.

You will meet a lot of other characters along the way.




PL has a free demo version, version 0.9.1. You'll have to find the download link through my twitter though because I'm not allowed to publicly link it here. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you're a patron however, you can download the lastest versionfor $1+ v0.99 from here:

What's up Jabronis. My Name is Steven and for the past 4 years I have been making videos on YouTube and I absolutely love it. From Reviews to Podcast to Top 10s and Reactions. My content can range from anything in Geek Culture be it Comics, Movies, TV Shows and even WWE related content.

I want to thank everyone who has stuck with me through the channels often transformations. I have always known what I wanted GeekedOutNation to be but have never been able to make it the dream I have for it. I love to love things in geek culture and have always believed that you should geek out about anything no matter what it is. The channel was meant to be a place where you could feel connected and never judged, a Nation of people who wanted to geek out and have someone they can connect with.

I love making Top 10 videos because it gives you an insight into my thoughts on the topic of the video, the problem is that editing videos is a long process for me. I have to go through what the list will be, narrow down the list from dozens of choices and write paragraphs on each one chosen(3-5 Hr). After that, I have to record the audio(1Hr), create the graphics, look up the information that will go in the graphic, find all the video footage and pictures that I will put in the video, edit it together, render it, upload it and fill out the YouTube information(6-8Hr). This is all because I don‚Äôt have the best computer and certain parts of the process take longer than they need too. I have a lot of different ideas for the channel & want it to grow but don‚Äôt have the time, manpower and money to do so.

Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, this is not me complaining because I love making videos. It is just that as you have seen consistency has been an issue for me due to the amount of time it takes to do everything. With YouTube not being my full-time job, I have to make time to do it and that leaves me with little hours of sleep and not as much content as I would like for you guys.

Now, this brings us to the main reason as to why I am here on Patreon. I am on Patreon in hopes that I can make video creation my full-time job in the future.Your contribution will help me provide all of you with more content with better quality at a more regular and consistent rate. The dream is to grow the channel to the point where I can move beyond Patreon and still give you guys quality, consistent content.

Supporting Geeked Out Nation means that not only will I continue to deliver free content, but I will also be able to upgrade and expand the channel beyond my dream. So whether you just give $1 or chose a higher tier everything you give will be to support Geeked Out Nation going forward. Anything you are able to give on Patreon, I want you to know and understand that it means the world to me and the future of the channel will truly be in your hands.


I want to make sure that I tell you guys my future plans as of right now with the channel. Below I will list ideas for shows I have had and look to the Patreon supporters which sound the most pleasing.

is a first-person POV adult adventure where you control the Male Main Character. 
You are returning to your childhood home to visit your mother's best friend Monica and Monica's two daughter's whom you grew up with. It has been several years since you've seen them, so the game centers around the MC's quest to re-build these old relationships, forge new ones and deal with everything life has to throw at you including the fallout from your deceased Father's will.... In addition to these three ladies, there'll be plenty of other characters in play (friends, foes, neighbors, stalkers and the ""Coffee-Shop Girl"").
There will be some minor / major plot storylines with a primary focus on conversation based choices & action based choices.
Some characters will be easier/harder to ""crack"" and some relationships will be a slow-burn romance (or corruption) while others will be a quick passionate affair (or rejection).
It's up to you to get the required results by figuring out what characters like or don't like and making the right choices to get there.   is being developed using the Renpy gaming engine with Full-HD (1920 x 1080) rendered graphics.

We are creating Adult content (Games / Visual Novels) under the label .

(JesseCox),"1,468",,,1436,Oct 2016,"Ever since I left the warm embrace of the YouTube network scene and forged ahead on my own, I've struggled with the idea that things would inevitably get harder. While I'm thrilled to be working on my own and creating my own path, I've also seen that with this comes the danger of copyright strikes, demonetization issues, and other traps of the solo YouTube gamer. That said, rather than worry about a video getting flagged, I would rather create a complete entertainment experience.

There are two major goals of this Patreon:.


 The first donation goal supports animation. Many of you love the Cox n' Crendor animation series. With your help, our animator, Dan, is working full time on a 50-day production schedule. That means ! In addition, it helps pay for Julian to create Coxtoons and opens up the option of working with other animators in the future.


The next donation goal is for a . Editing and rendering takes a long time, and when I'm doing that, I'm not recording videos. As the channel grows and changes our editing team will be working hard creating content like the Gentlemen's Hentai Club, The Gentlemen's Gaming Club, Coxtease, Scary Game Squad, and getting Fan Friday back where it's supposed to be.... on Saturday morning. It's because of this patreon that we got to explore crazier ideas like GHC, so thank you!

We're talking flying in friends to do Co-op (no more waiting for Crendor to visit to record Outlast 2 for instance), hosting more 24 hour event streams at the office, creating live events both here in LA and in cities near you, and my dream series ""Cox n' Crendor show where I take Crendor around to famous old stuff and film it.""



With your help, I know we can make some really entertaining and wild Cox content. 

You have my supreme thanks and gratitude for any support you can offer. - Jesse"

Before creating Samurai Boy, my award winning webcomic, I also illustrated and co-aothored several children's books and comics.
I teach visual arts in some of the most prestigious universities in Brazil and I have a Master‚Äôs degree in Visual Arts (Cinema and Comics) at the University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), having studied film adaptation from comics. I also specialized in Art History and graduated as a bachelor in Advertising.
Besides comic books, I loves samurais, romance novels, tv series, cartoons and videogames. And comic books. (Have I mentioned it already?)

With contributions through Patreon, I am able to work on comics full-time creating Samurai Boy and other series along the way. I can refine my process and improve the comic. Also, I can increase the rate at which I deliver pages and complete stories. So by supporting me on Patreon, it helps ensure that my comics keep going and (hopefully) getting better.

As my patron, you gain early access to comic pages and strips. Also, you will get exclusive content such as sketches, full illustrations and high resolution artwork.

We‚Äôre your friendly neighborhood chiptune rock band, and believe it or not we‚Äôve been beaming iridescent 8-bit tones into your ears for over a decade now. But enough about us! Or, actually, I guess lots more about us since this is the description page for our Patreon and that‚Äôs likely the information you‚Äôre hoping to read.

The First Album Adventure

Way back in 2017, we launched our first Album Adventure on Patreon with a simple concept: what if we made an album from scratch, giving our Patrons full access to every step of the process and involving them in cool ways as the album came to life? People could join or leave at any time, and no one would be charged a cent until the album was done.

Well, 2.5 years, 1 fully released album (Canon Eyes), and 116 ‚ÄúAdventure Thing‚Äù weekly posts later, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the whole thing was really rather fun, dare we even say ‚Äúadventurous‚Äù (we daren‚Äôt, yet we must).

Album Adventure 2: Judgment Day / Back In The Habit / Fievel Goes West

And did we ever have some grand plans for 2020! Did we ever? Honestly at this point it‚Äôs hard to remember anything from before 2020‚Ä¶

Regardless, we have conceived of a very fun concept for our second Album Adventure! We‚Äôre calling it ‚ÄúSide Quest‚Äù, and over the course of the next 6 months we‚Äôre going to crack open our epic vault of unreleased and semi-released tracks (there‚Äôs over 120!) and release them to Patrons.



The plan - ah yes the plan. The plan is to release one never-before-heard, completely unreleased track every week: a demo, unused album recording, or something we did for a special project that never saw the light of day.

Along with that unreleased track, we‚Äôll also post a handful of semi-released tracks with writeups about the stories behind them: this includes collections like DEMOlition, The Future Imperfect, Project Atma tracks, old email list tracks, and more that have been put out into the world in some way but that fans might not have heard before unless they‚Äôve been listening for our entire career and/or done some dedicated internet digging.

We‚Äôre also going to pick a handful of these tracks and do full new studio recordings of them, and in the end we‚Äôll put out an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù b-sides album, both on digital music services like Spotify and as a physical CD / LP (likely a double record given the amount of tracks we have!).



I‚Äôm glad you asked! Just like our last adventure, the Patreon tiers are designed to bring you into the process of making the record. We‚Äôll be collecting feedback from Patrons as we sort through these tracks, including helping to shape the final track list for the album and helping us decide which songs should get proper studio recordings.

Additionally, there are levels that allow you to put your stamp on the record itself, through having your name in the credits, singing on one of the new studio tracks, and even getting an executive producer credit.



While our Album Adventures aren‚Äôt the typical use case for Patreon, it has been the perfect platform for us. Here‚Äôs a few important pieces of info about Patreon and how we use it:




That‚Äôs it! As always, we are incredibly grateful and frankly somewhat astounded that we‚Äôve gotten to make music for you for the past decade, and we cannot wait to take this adventure down memory lane with you.

Prints of the 1890s gown sketch and Chemise √† la Reine will be sent to all patrons pledged under either of the mailing tiers ($20 and $50) as of 1 March, 2020. 

Dear Friend,
Well met!
If we aren't already acquainted, hello! I am a dress historian and costume interpreter known best for my series of YouTube videos documenting my experiments in historical garment reconstruction and adaptation for modern wear. Primarily my area of study spans from the Norman Conquest (1066) up through the introduction of the electric sewing machine (c.1919) and thus I work mostly by hand in an attempt to reproduce garments according to historical practice. My goal is to spread the joy of rediscovering old crafts, of research and experimentation, of hypothesising on how things may have been done and embarking on mad, time-consuming, and extraordinarily fiddly adventures in trying to bring the past to life...










...and then to see how we can apply these lost methods to 21st century life.



In Real Life I work as a freelance research consultant and illustrator based primarily in New York, and secondarily in London where I get to work with the brilliant team at the School of Historical Dress. Some of my recent reconstruction and illustration work can be found in the newly-released Patterns of Fashion 5, including artwork for 'The Staymaker's Tale'.

Jon Denton ," Music Reactions, Reviews and more! (jondenton)","1,455",,,337,Nov 2019,"First up, thank you for landing on my Patreon page! Just taking the time to click the link and read this section means the world. 

Quite simply, I'm now at a huge crossroads in my career, and the time has come to commit fully to YouTube, to music reactions, reviews, streams and other content, but in order to do so, I NEED YOUR HELP!

As I'm sure you know by now, the music reaction game on YouTube is HARD! Despite strong views, huge support from artists and even bigger support from fans and viewers (THANK YOU!), record labels are taking every single penny of revenue, thanks to automated content claims that either block the video entirely or vacuum up any ad-rev the videos earn.

Through Patreon support, my channel and content has the opportunity to become self-sustainable, and that will also allow me the time and stability to continue the conversation with the labels, so hopefully one day the likes of UMG, WMG and SME will see how videogames have flourished on YouTube, and allow us in the music reaction community to do the same.

By signing up as a Patron at the $5 tier, you'll not only be directly responsible for this channel's future existence, growth and evolution, but you'll also gain access to:







As we hit Patron number goals, I can begin looking at enhancing what I do and delivering significantly more content, higher quality content, and deeper interaction with you guys. 

Quite simply - without support from you amazing people, this would all be impossible.

So THANK YOU!

Over a decade late, they continue to defend a methodology that is utterly inappropriate for the economy, and dangerously misleading about the relationship between the economy and the ecology of our planet.

I am fortunate that I realised how bad mainstream economics was when I was an undergraduate student almost 50 years ago. Since then, I have worked tirelessly to develop an alternative, realistic economics. My book Debunking Economics has let tens of thousands of readers learn in one month the critical knowledge of economics that I spent four decades acquiring. The ""complex systems"" model of Hyman Minsky's ""Financial Instability Hypothesis I developed in 1992 let me warn of the 2008 crisis before it happened. I designed Minsky, the Open Source dynamic modelling program, to make it possible for anyone to build and understand monetary models of the economy. My latest book Can We Avoid Another Financial Crisis? explains why the crisis happened, and what we have to do to end it. I have just developed the first explanation of production in which energy plays an essential role, opening up the possibility to finally integrate economics and ecology.

But much more needs to be done, and I need your help to do it.

I have done everything till now with support from many colleagues, but with no support from official funding agencies. Almost all the money for economics research goes to develop the mainstream--even after it has failed so abjectly. That will continue to be the case.

Universities have also been starved of research funding over the years, and buried under bureaucratic controls. They no longer provide the time and freedom they once gave to original thinkers like me. It's so bad now that the best way for me to have the time and resources to build a new economics is to leave the University sector, and get supported directly by the public.

Today,  and  across the globe are calling for a realistic economics to replace the delusional theories that led us into this economic mess. You can help me produce that realistic economics by becoming my Patron for as little as $1 a month. If I've changed how you think about economics, help me have that impact on others."

Avialae is a webcomic about a gross bird boy and his nerdy wannabe ornithologist boyfriend--Imeanneighbor who helps him out during the painful and bloody process of growing wings. It is a NSFW comic, so you must be 18+ to support this Patreon.

I've been doing Avialae since 2014, and thanks to Patreon support it is now my full-time job! I'm so grateful for the opportunity to dedicate myself fully to doing something I love. I treat my Patreon as a mix between a subscription service and a way to publicly fund Avialae. I want to give patrons real rewards for their contributions while at the same time letting the webcomic exist publicly for free. 


Thanks to Patreon support I have been able to start a Patreon-exclusive side comic for Avialae called . It tells the story of Silas and Ezra. I update Occultus every Monday, and it is only available for $10+ patrons.


I have also recently started a new BL webcomic called ! It's about two paranormal investigators, but instead of finding ghosts they find each other's lips. Also one's a werewolf and the other is really stupid. The Hunt doesn't have a set schedule since Avialae and Occultus take priority, but I update on Fridays when I can. $14+ patrons also get early access to pages!

[Aquest √©s un text per demanar-te la pasta. Si ja tens clar que no ens en vols donar, o tens clar que s√≠ que ens en vols donar, o ets Josep Maria Bartomeu, no cal que el llegeixis]

Ja ho sabeu: La Sotana √©s un programa d'esports, √©s a dir de futbol, √©s a dir del Bar√ßa, √©s a dir de Messi. 100% lliure de periodistes, √©s un espai on l'actualitat blaugrana √©s analitzada com es mereix: tendenciosament i en calent, sense cap mena de rigor ni m√©s pretensi√≥ que oferir als oients una hora de r√†dio lliure, allunyada del to i dels t√≤pics habituals a la informaci√≥ esportiva i bla, bla, bla.

Despr√©s de m√©s de quatre anys fent el programa en condicions molt variades, ens ha quedat clar que no hi ha lloc per a nosaltres als mitjans tradicionals. Tamb√© ho podr√≠em haver vist abans, certament. En tot cas, tamb√© tenim clar que no volem deixar de fer programa. Per molts motius, per√≤ b√†sicament perqu√® no ens dona la gana. 



Per√≤, per poder continuar fent La Sotana,

A la columna de la dreta hi trobar√†s quins paquets de subscripci√≥ pots triar i les seves respectives recompenses. A la de l'esquerra, quins objectius tenim i quins s√≥n els seus costos.

Aquest Patreon neix de la voluntat de fer una Sotana 100% autoprodu√Øda, sense intermediaris i tan lliure com nosaltres mateixos siguem capa√ßos de permetre'ns. Per tant, aquest √©s l'objectiu n√∫mero 1.

Aix√≤ vol dir que no tenim previst forrar-nos, tot i que √©s una idea que s√≠ que ens sembla atractiva. Si superem els costos m√≠nims (el lloguer d'espai i material, principalment) i podem cobrar alguna cosa, encantats. Si us torneu bojos i ens doneu tants cal√©s que La Sotana pot cr√©ixer i fer coses noves, encara m√©s encantats.

Tot i que alguns continguts passin a ser de pagament, el podcast continuar√† essent gratu√Øt i, sincerament, el far√≠em igualment encara que no munt√©ssim tot aquest tinglado. O sigui que les recompenses i objectius d'aquest Patreon, malgrat seran complerts escrupolosament, nom√©s s√≥n l'excusa per demanar-nos que ens ajudeu a continuar cridant cada setmana que l'emperador va despullat."

It's an Adult RPG game set in a medieval fantasy world, where you play a farmer's son on his quest to make a name for himself, and perhaps rescue a few damsels in distress along the way.

Peasant's Quest
Although this game features a lot of sexual material, it's not just about clicking a button to get to the next image. I want the gameplay to be enjoyable in it's self.
My goal is to create an open-world game, featuring nonlinear quests (meaning; you decide when and which quests to do). You'll be able to interact with many of the creatures you meet. Their attitude towards you and storyline will depend on how you treat them. This being an adult game; expect a few pregnancies along the way as well!
The gameplay itself is 2D, based on the RPG Maker MV game engine, cutscene artwork I create in a 3D rendering program called DAZ Studio.

Development
I've been developing the game for close to two years now and although it has grown a lot, I'm constantly adding new quests and features. This means your input will still able to influence the direction and storyline of the game.


Although I've been developing this game as a hobby, I spend a seriously unhealthy amount of time on it.  Even though I don't have to pay myself, game development isn't free. The game assets I use (software, objects, textures, clothing, etc.), cost thousands of dollars and without financial support development would quickly run to a halt. I know you expect a return on your investment and I do my utmost to deliver.
For your investment you'll be able to play new versions of the game as soon as they are complete, and you will be able to influence game development with your suggestions. I eagerly look forward to your suggestions and feedback!


You can download a free public version from my website:

Unfortunately the current YouTube ad landscape isn't so great for creators like us, with YouTube loving to push that demonetization button. But there's a way to help us out and support us directly, and that's by signing up to our Patreon!

Why should I support Hardware Unboxed?
We work hard to deliver quality, in-depth tech content! We don't cut corners, except when it comes to sleep.

You might have seen our massive benchmark videos and other detailed analysis of current tech products. These videos take time to create, so supporting us directly will help us keep making this content, and keep our videos easily accessible through YouTube.

You'll also help us sleep and eat, so big thanks to all the fans and everyone who supports us directly.

What do I get out of it?
Firstly, supporting us directly will help keep the channel alive and help us keep making awesome videos.

But we do also provide exclusive benefits for those that support us through here. Patrons can access a monthly live stream with us, join our exclusive Discord channel to chat about tech, and even watch some exclusive behind the scenes videos.

We're offering a wide range of tiers so you can back us for whatever amount you like and get access to cool stuff. We didn't want to make anything too expensive, so backing us at any amount will get you access to exclusive content.

Thanks to everyone who watches our videos, engages with us, and supports the channel. Without fans like you, we wouldn't be in a position to make tech videos as a full time job.

We publish a lot of content to Patreon. It's hard to find things. Here are some quick links for our members to use if they want to find our exclusive videos and other content."

We're Taifun Riders. Creators of the adult game Space Paws.

Right now, we're starting the development of our new project: Shuggerlain - Beyond Time.
We are doing our best just to try to make something great. We don't want to create just a game. We really want to make something great and enjoyable for the most of the players.

When we say are adult game creators it just doesn't mean there're NSFW animations on our games. We try to bring to the players an adult experience, in all its meaning. Great sex animations, great gameplay, and good plot. That's our goal.

For this reason even if you were and old patreon, a follower, or just a fan of our games, we'd really appreciate your support for this incoming project. We're investing in more resources, more comissioning, new software...just to try to be always improving. And we all know this stuff has a cost.

The journey has started.
Will you join us? :)

RULES FOR THE COMMENTS (it's sad that we are forced to make them...*sigh*):
-No bullying
-No racism
-No drama
-No ads / spam (don't mention personal projects, games you're developing...)
-Don't ask for violent H-scenes or something like that
-Don't ask for loli
-Respect each other. Don't be a dickhead.
-Enjoy"

For nearly twelve years now The Angry Joe Show has been ranting, raving about, and reviewing every facet of the gaming industry! It's been an incredible ride and we love bringing you the most thorough and honest content available on YouTube. Though with recent changes in online advertising and rampant demonetization on Youtube we need your help to bring the same 'quality' content that you've known and loved for more than a decade.

Nothing is going to stop us from making the content we've dedicated our lives to create, though with a little help from fans who wish to support us, we can do so without external pressures to censor ourselves, tone down our reviews, or bow to Corporate Commander.

All of the content you're used to will still be available absolutely free of charge. We don't believe in gating the essential content that you've come to know from us. That means that all of our core shows; Angry Reviews, Movie Reviews, AJS News Episodes, Angry Rants, Trailer Reactions, TV Series Reviews, Rapid Fire Reviews, Lets Plays, Game Design Videos, Top Lists, Extended Discussions, etc. will ALWAYS be FREE of CHARGE and will not change at all!

What we can offer those who wish to support the Show is basically some extra bits of footage that usually gets cut out in editing, stuff like bloopers, alternate takes, or silly ideas that weren't used from the main videos... basically non-content that's left over and that we've got lying around on our hard drives accumulated from 12 years of video editing!




It's always good to set expectations up front so lets do that now! This way there's no miscommunication about what this is or what it isn't!











So that's it! I can always add more to this section as we get more and more questions (or move it to an official FAQ section if they have that here somewhere!)

Full Patreon Exclusive Comics: Full comics are released on PDF to Comics Patrons and higher tiers. A month afterwards all Patrons will have access to the image version of of the comic. Non-Patrons will see the comic posted slowly throughout the month on twitter and other gallery sites.

I don't guarantee a full new exclusive comic every month, that'd stress me out to no end. But I'll try my best to provide new content every month.

We're in the process of rebuilding currently, as well as updating you guys on what's been going on.

--

The Valleyfolk exists because the world could use some friends right now.

We are a crowd-funded comedy collective that launched in January of 2018 and since then, thanks to the help of our incredible community of patrons, has managed to not only survive but actually thrive in this insane world of digital entertainment. We don‚Äôt have a million subscribers, nor are we trying to obey algorithms or follow the trends to get us there. We believe The Valleyfolk is greater than the sum of its parts, and as such, we let our content speak for itself.


It‚Äôs weird.

It‚Äôs dark.

It‚Äôs not for everyone.

But if you‚Äôre here, it‚Äôs probably


The founding members of The Valleyfolk are Joe Bereta, Elliott Morgan, Steve Zaragoza, and Lee Newton. But we are also part of a larger community of friends, creators, and comedians hailing from SourceFed, the now-defunct-but-once-wondrous comedy/news YouTube channel. This is a very professional sounding paragraph for what often amounts to fart jokes and french horns, but hey, it‚Äôs a pitch, what do you expect?


We began The Valleyfolk with the intention of making whatever we wanted, without answering to anyone. Now, as we approach 2020, we want to do more of that, and take what we have learned and catapult ourselves to greater heights. Our patrons understand that it‚Äôs not just about the copious amounts of high-quality exclusive content that they get as a member; I mean, what if‚Ä¶ what if we actually make it, and this weird brand of humor we have infects the masses?


Becoming a patron means you allow us to provide ourselves and our editors (and soon: producer!) with livable wages. Your patronage allows us to have an office (with internet!), health insurance, and money for when we need to buy fake blood, stupid props, or sex socks. Don‚Äôt ask. It‚Äôs important, but please don‚Äôt ask.


Don‚Äôt believe we use your hard-earned cash wisely? Here‚Äôs a list of some things we‚Äôve done over the past (almost) two years SOLELY


: Nearly every week, The Valleyfolk uploads Your Show, a TV-length YouTube show that mixes improv, sketch, and our patrons questions/prompts. It is our flagship show and has grown steadily since its launch‚Äî the point that we‚Äôve even gotten some sponsors! Whoa!


: In case you think we‚Äôre full of crap, there‚Äôs also Trivia Bidet. From the mind of Joe Bereta (Barats & Bereta, SourceFed, Smosh) comes this demented game show that mixes trivia with, well‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll call it ‚Äúhygiene.‚Äù


: The Valleycast is the official podcast of The Valleyfolk, which features some or all of the group discussing what they‚Äôre excited about each week. It‚Äôs unscripted, uncensored, and unhinged, and PATRONS get it earlier than everyone else.


: Thanks to our dedicated audience AND our friends within the community who silently cheer us on as we lose our minds, we even won a NATIONAL TELEVISION SHOW! HOLY CRAP! The Valleyfolk won the first season of NBC‚Äôs Bring The Funny, and we did so by performing sketches we knew our audience (that‚Äôs you!) would like. If that doesn‚Äôt show the power of our weird tribe, I don‚Äôt know what will. Magical spells, maybe?


: Inspired by SourceFed, HOT TAKE is Elliott‚Äôs stab at Daily Show-esque content, all shot in one take, on the first try, with zero cuts, and probably some messes that need to be cleaned up after. For folks who still enjoy social commentary but don‚Äôt want to be bogged down by actual information, it‚Äôs perfect!


: Our Patreon content is as high-quality as the majority of our other videos, if not even better! And they‚Äôre exclusively for the folks who make all of this possible.


: Uncanny Valley is our show for our VIP-and-up patrons. The way we see it, if you‚Äôre forking over as much as you do for Netflix, then you deserve at least ONE completely exclusive piece of content that‚Äôs just for you. Uncanny Valley mixes puppets with humans as they react to old SourceFed videos, other viral hits, or even unreleased Valleyfolk sketches! It‚Äôs very good.


: The Valleyfolk has done some live shows and we‚Äôre gearing up to do more! Patrons usually get discounted tickets (depending on if we can arrange it), and they‚Äôre a sight to behold. We sell out theaters and entertain you with stand-up, sketches, songs, poems, and good old-fashioned riffing.


Is it worth it to mention the merchandise we‚Äôve released, the songs we‚Äôve written, the standalone sketches we‚Äôve done, the guests we‚Äôve had, the things we‚Äôve guested on, the partnerships we‚Äôve formed or any of the other REALLY FRICKIN‚Äô COOL THINGS we‚Äôve accomplished in a very little time? I mean, I did say we want to let our content speak for itself. But then I did still kind of mention those things by not mentioning them, so‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just let this paragraph (not?) speak for itself? You get the idea.


We‚Äôre making moves."

For your various pledges, you'll get first access to my work, and the exclusive perk of being able to submit prompts that I might draw on my doodle days. You would also be making the work exist, since I will not be able to create most of this work without your help!

Among the projects you'd be funding currently, the lowest level is my monthly ""doodle day"" where I'll collect prompts and draw as many of them in one day as I can. As for the comics on the higher levels, I'm working on a dark fantasy adventure called The Dirt Crown, and an explicit M/M horror/detective comic called This Vacant Body, as well as various themed SFW and NSFW comics containing M/M romantic content. For pledging on any tier, you also get access to my backlog of updates, which means you can read completed comics like Sweet Bear, my chibi bara comic about making friends in weird situations, and various other completed projects like The Contemplative Man, Wayfinding, and my big Coffee Shop AU :) If you follow me on tumblr you've got an idea of what kind of stuff I'm into ;)

EEVblog , Electronics Engineering Videos (eevblog),"1,378",,,2481,Dec 2013,"Hi, I'm Dave Jones from the EEVblog.
I've been creating Electronics Engineering Youtube videos since April 2009, with over 1300 episodic engineering videos with hundreds more on my 2nd and other channels.
I create a wide variety of electronics engineering related videos, from tutorials, teardowns, industry advice, repairs and product reviews through to debunking of crowd funding scams and dodgy products (so few people are doing this!) among an eclectic mix of content.
I also run and manage one of the world's largest public engineering forums.

Doing all this takes a lot of time and effort and as such this has been my full time job since 2011.
To continue to do this full time I have to have other income streams outside of Youtube. And as several Youtube Adpocolypse's have shown, earning money on Youtube is always on shaky ground, so this is where Patreon comes in. If you find value in my content and want to show your support financially, then Patreon is great place to do this.

All of my content is free for everyone, I don't produce exclusive content for Patrons, but Patrons do get early access to new videos which allows you to have some technical input before it goes live to the public. I can also share news, and have occasional giveaways and other promotions for Patrons only, and I also do the occasional live hangout with Patrons. You can also contact me directly bypassing the ton of noise I get being a big(ish) channel.

You'll also get access to the exclusive EEVBlog Discord server!

Please only pledge what you can afford, and feel free to adjust your level at any time, every dollar is much appreciated. All Patrons regardless of level get access to the same perks."

If you sign up to become a patron at any level, you're part of the secret demo club. Every month I send out a brand new home demo for the club to stream here & download, written & produced by me in my bedroom studio.

Signing up at any level means access to the secret demo club discord server and patron-only feed full of voice memos, blog posts & videos.. me documenting the whole process. If you'd like to support at a higher tier there are other rewards like monthly live streams & access to the entire archive of demos from 2016 to the present day. COOL.

As an independent artist, this patreon thing is game-changing. The collective support of the secret demo club has allowed me to tour and to record, release & market the music I want to with zero compromise. I won't let you down

DISCLAIMER: This Patreon takes payment upfront! Be careful if you're pledging near the end of the month!

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How does the BIG FISH tier work? How do I suggest characters for Animation Polls and Request Streams? (Putting this question up top so people can see it! More general info below the cut!)

Good Question! Here's how it works basically, during the 1st of every month I make a post on Patreon asking for suggestions for the animation poll! You can comment on that post and suggest whatever character you'd like (excluding OCs!) and other patrons will be able to vote for them in the animation poll! The posts lasts usually until around 6pm EST the next day, so be sure to get your submissions in before then!

For request streams the process is similar, but OCs are totally allowed! A few days before a stream I'll make a post announcing the time/date of the stream as well as asking for suggestions! Simply comment on that post with your request! As a disclaimer, I cannot draw ALL the requests given, but I try to do at least 5 B&W sketches of the ones I find most interesting per stream! Streams happen once or twice a month!





WHA, NO!! After a lot of thought I've decided to make this Patreon as an alternative to purely commissions! It's been a rough few months, my commissioners are all lovely wonderful people who have helped me a lot but sadly commissions themselves aren't really sustainable! It's nobody's fault, but they leave me with very little free time for even less money! Furthermore, for things I want to do like animations, it's incredibly hard for one commissioner to afford! Therefore, this is my solution!



I'll be upfront about it, I dislike paywalls and artists that hoard all their content behind Patreon, but at the same time there has to be some incentive right? So how I want to go about it is this: pledging will give you , as well as the ! At higher goals, patrons will be able to suggest characters and potentially even have their suggestions chosen to be animated!

I want to be transparent and say that I'll be posting what goes on here onto my blog /eventually/, probably somewhere between a week to a month later, but please understand I have to keep some things hidden for a while so patrons can get their money's worth! 



I think so far my ""brand"" is mainly girls with big tums, so that's what you can expect here as well! When I put up character polls, after one is chosen I'll make another deciding what kind of picture it'll be (pregnancy, stuffing, vore, etc). Really it's up to all of you to decide if this Patreon takes on any specific flavor!

With special regards to vore though.. I want to be honest and say that if you're coming here mainly for the slightly harder/more sadistic fatal type of vore I'd be wary before pledging! When vore is chosen as a topic for a picture I'll more often than not keep it more safe/soft, with implied digestion at most. Basically, think the kind of vore I've done in the past! I don't have anything against the more fatal-y types of vore, but personally I don't want to do that sort of content! So keep that in mind if that's what you're coming here for!



Honestly, I have no idea what to expect with this haha, I'm really just hoping that I can have the ability to make better stuff for you all! If this hopefully goes well, you'll be seeing more better-er animation from me, as well as maybe things like comic projects, etc!

Thanks for your time!!"

I'm a Chilean freelance artist with a few years of experience on illustrations and comics and this is my Patreon. The material you will found here is +18, 100% NSFW and it will be here at your disposal.

After a while making commissioned illustrations, adult comics pages and sexy pinups for a lot of different people, I feel the need to create my own stories and characters. And what kind of material could be better than a Hentai manga?!



A 10-20 pages hentai manga with story and characters chosen by you guys! The idea is to have fun creating this project. You will take care of the big decisions and I‚Äôm going to be in charge of the drawings.



The categories start form the pure access to the story as the minimum reward, to the opportunity to choose the story, context and characters. Of course there is also, access to my work in case u want to know more about my process. Things like layered PSD file of the cover, pages, character sheets and the layout of the full story will be available in the second tier.



My intention is to bring this hentai manga every month using all my available time to draw the pages but, if we reach some goals, I will be able to work full time on this having time to share more original pages, making some video process of my page work and even create an animated gif of the best scene every time I upload a story.

Feel free to comment, ask anything or just send me your thoughts. I'll answer as soon as I can!

Effectively Wild has been active since July 2012, first with Ben and Sam at Baseball Prospectus, then with Ben and Jeff Sullivan at , and now with Ben, Sam, and Meg at FanGraphs. Over time, our episodes have gotten longer, more painstakingly produced, and more popular, which has come at a cost in time and money.

Interacting with our listeners has made the work rewarding, but after 1350-plus episodes (and counting), we can't record the podcast for free, as Ben and Sam did for the first 850 episodes. Effectively Wild will always be a labor of love, but Ben works for The Ringer and Sam works for ESPN, which means the podcast isn't part of their jobs. For the show to continue in its current form, we also need it to be the kind of labor that leads to income. Your support will compensate Ben, Sam, Meg, and editor Dylan Higgins, cover our hosting expenses, and ensure that the show survives while remaining free of the same ads you have to skip past on other podcasts.

The fact that you are on this page reveals that you have thought about the process that goes into creating content for CaspianReport. The inspiration for this channel comes from Plato‚Äôs Allegory of the Cave. We seek to explore geopolitical, economic and social issues by interpreting the shadows cast on the wall, producing objective media content as a result.

Since 2011, our YouTube channel has grown to a community of 400.000 subscribers with more than 300 videos published, collecting over 50 million views in the process.

FUNDRAISING
Supporting CaspianReport on Patreon will enable us to generate funds to cover expenses such as staff costs, licenses and stock footages. It will also allow us to bring in assistance with the research, writing and editing. This will permit us to release more frequent reports with a greater variety of topics.

REWARDS
Several reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription. Any of them will give you immediately gain access to the CaspianReport feed at Patreon.

If you enjoy our work and would like to support us, you can do so on a per-report basis. We release 4-5 reports per month on average, and you can also cap your budget. Either way, every little bit is appreciated because it allows us to remain fully funded by our audience. In turn, our financial self-reliance enables us to stay independent.

To the best of our abilities, we will answer inquiries, but we don't take personal submissions or sponsored content.

Who is Erika and what is Oh Joy Sex Toy?
I am an 18 year comics veteran living in Portland, OR. My ongoing webcomic right now (and for the past several years) is Oh Joy Sex Toy, a light-hearted, funny, sex positive educational webcomic.

It updates weekly and covers a wide spectrum of the world of sex; from sex toy reviews to sex education to interviews with sex industry professionals and more. Here is a collection of my favorite strips.



I don‚Äôt just make Oh Joy Sex Toy myself. With the aid of Patreon backers, my husband Matt and I hire guest artists to write and draw comics for the site, to get us as many diverse perspectives as possible. We aim to be as relevant as possible to people of all genders, body types, and sexualities.

By helping me here, even at just a $1 level, you help me make and bring more sex positive comics into the world.




‚ÄúA great and hilarious resource - some of the best sex ed out there!‚Äù -

‚ÄúOur parents had The Joy of Sex, we have the next generation of totally balls-out (and vulva-out!) candidness in Oh Joy Sex Toy!! Oh Joy Sex Toy is sui generis‚Ä¶ there may not be a book in print simultaneously this honest, this educational, and THIS HILARIOUS‚Äù -

‚ÄúIt is written and drawn with such gosh-darn sweet enthusiasm by Erika Moen (with the occasional guest-shot from husband Matthew, who provides a dude‚Äôs perspective) that even if your tastes are tamer than Moen‚Äôs, I think you‚Äôll find it a perfectly wonderful read.‚Äù -

Pledging is and allows you access to all sorts of great behind-the-scenes and Patreon-exclusive posts!



For just, you get I‚Äôve found that having this private space here gives me freedom to talk about stuff like my creative process, the unique challenges that come with this job and behind-the-curtain life stuff.

At the tier, you also get access toof my previous comic series,  Originally published as books in 2009 and 2010, both of these PDFs include comics and bonus content that was never released online.


You will be charged at the end of the month, when Patreon tallies up how many updates I posted during that time. OJST typically updates four times a month (Except for months with five weeks), so if you pledged , then at the end of the month you will be charged. You can totally set a cap on how much you‚Äôre willing to be charged each month, so even if I update a million times you won‚Äôt be charged beyond your maximum amount. You can edit or cancel your pledge any time before you‚Äôre charged. .


Backers‚Äô pledges will be applied when I run guest comics. I commission my guest cartoonists to create these comics to not only add more perspectives to Oh Joy Sex Toy but to fill in when I am sick or injured or otherwise unable to complete a comic on my own.

The artists are compensated and while they retain full ownership of their strip and are free to use it to generate additional income from what I‚Äôve paid them, they also grant me a non-exclusive license to profit from it through my comic‚Äôs avenues.


No problem-o! You can and thank you so much for your support! :D


Cool! You can  and then we get rewarded from our website overlords!


We run solely on the financial support generated through company affiliations, advertising, merchandise, and the individual support of readers. If you would like to support our sex educating work so we can continue to keep creating these comics full-time, please consider 

My ginormous, beautiful, angel cat Flapjack doesn‚Äôt actually help with anything but he‚Äôs really pretty.

Amber , the Medicine Stories Podcast (MedicineStories),"1,349",,,1046,Nov 2017,"These past months I've been feeling a pull. First quiet, dream-like... then louder.  I started getting curious what it wanted to be, gave it some attention, and now I‚Äôm hooked. So after 15 years of touring, I‚Äôm stopping. For now. Stay off the road (mostly) these next 6 months in a cottage nestled between the woods and a creek. No distractions, no internet, and massive amounts of nature and ink.  And follow the creation of this world that‚Äôs started to show itself.

So I wake up pre-dawn, write by candlelight 'til the sun comes up, dance with this unknown creation ‚Äòtil it's time to make a fire.  Read, write, research, record.  Excavate the world.  Unplugged from the outside minus the immediate world through my window.  And an occasional check-in to make sure everything‚Äôs still rolling along out there.

Routine is a challenge when life has become so familiar with chaos and movement.  But this feels important to me and I‚Äôm curious. Pieces are already finding each other, characters and themes starting to emerge, and my subconscious and dreams becoming their own little ecosystem.  All the incredible experiences I‚Äôve had on the road, from Japan and South Korea to South Africa, Europe, US, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica.... every person I‚Äôve met, every place I‚Äôve been, everything I‚Äôve felt is being woven into this next creation.

If you have additional ideas for offerings, things you'd like to hear or see or know, say it here! I want this to be a generous space where we can communicate and share.  So in addition to the monthly subscription (everyone gets all access to everything) I've created sponsorships for those who want to support a full day, week or month of my creativity.  For this, I‚Äôll be forever grateful and include you in my daily gratitude, plus hand-make a special one-of-a-kind gift for the time you've sponsored.  And if you know me, you know I have a tendency to go overboard on my ""little gifts""... (see shop.amberrubarth.com) 

Thank you for allowing me to take a bit of a risk and create something I‚Äôm feeling so artistically pulled toward.  It's a dream and I‚Äôm so fortunate to have you to share it with.

Big love from the little coffeeshop where I drove 20 minutes to find internet.

Abnormal Mapping , a podcast network for the rest of us. (abnormalmapping),"1,343","$3,679 per month",$2.74 per month,1251,May 2017,"Welcome to the Abnormal Mapping podcast network Patreon! We're a network focused on media criticism and good shows from marginal creators. We've been putting out podcasts since 2013, and in 2017 decided that to expand our efforts we would launch the Patreon you see before you today. We exist entirely off of the support of our audience, and most of our shows wouldn't even exist without the efforts people have already made in supporting our network.

Not only are we a podcast network, but we've also attempted to make Abnormal Mapping into a community, be that through our network discord or our goal to provide no-cost hosting to other like-minded people who would desire to make a podcast of their very own (more on that later). We want to create the podcast network we want to see in the world, something curious and invested in queer and progressive criticism and bringing together others who want the same.

Who Are We, and Why Are We Here:
Abnormal Mapping was founded and is run by Em Marko and Jackson Tyler. We host and produce most of our shows, run the Patreon, write articles, and generally try to pretend like we're more than just the two of us. This is basically the equivalent of both of us having a part time job! We'd suggest not making your hobbies your work, but it's doing okay for us so far. We're also joined by an array of other hosts and co-hosts that give their time and energy to casts hosted on the network. It's hard to schedule shows, and we're thankful to the efforts of everyone who helps us make the shows we have, have had, and will potentially have in the future.

Our first year on Patreon has been incredible so far, as we've gone from just a video game podcast to an array of shows that all reflect our ethos of good, fun, accessible critical podcasts. There's a show for nearly every taste, and hopefully in the future there will be something for literally everyone.


But what are the shows? Here are our extant shows!

- Our flagship show! A game club podcast we specifically designed to be accessible to people who haven't been drowning in games culture for their entire lives. Every month, we play a game and do a close read on our experiences, it's context, and how it fits into games now looking back. All of our episodes are evergreen and disconnected from the hype cycle, so any episode can be your first episode! You can find Abnormal Mapping at  and a list of all the games we've covered can be found .

- We love movies, even if going to the cinema to see the latest releases is often too expensive and too frustrating to do on the regular. So join Em, Jackson, and longtime third chair Destiny Sturdivant as we show up every two weeks to watch an old movie and learn a little more about this medium we call film. It's like an education, but way more friendly, because we also are new to this! Check it out at

- When the Gundam podcast can't contain all the anime, sometimes we find ourselves talking about other shows that don't fit the mecha milieu of GGP, or we have a patreon-requested thing to cover. All of these find themselves in the Your Uncle's Beach House feed, which is free for everyone , but also will just fold into the GGP feed if you listen to that!

- ON HIATUS We both love Star Trek, so much so that it was derailing our original podcast. Easy fix: let's make a Star Trek show! And so was born Second Officer Slog, a show about watching some episodes and reading one of the hundreds of Star Trek books and telling you just how far the final frontier goes when you're not on TV anymore. Allow us to be your guide through the ridiculous world of Star Trek fiction, no prior reading required. Comics, movie novelizations, awful short story collections? All can be found at .

- The band Coheed and Cambria is known for two things: one, having a singer with a really high voice, and two, someone saying ‚Äúdo you know all their songs have a story?‚Äù every time someone mentions them. Have you ever wanted to learn what that story is? Never fear, Jackson and  break down the lore track by track, and it is as hilarious and terrible as you would think. Spoilers: two children are dead by the end of the first song. It only kicks off more from there. To embark upon the journey, and see select panels of the tie-in comic, then head to: 

- Every month , , and Em all gather in comfy chairs to talk through the most literary form of video games: the visual novel. The quieter sister of Abnormal Mapping, Novel Not New is a deep dive into a genre that gets very little coverage in the gaming circles we keep. We argue about anime tropes, reflect on who to date, and generally seek to find the endings that speak to our hearts. You can find Novel Not New at  and see the games covered in our !

- According to our calculations, there are 945 episodes of the long running anime franchise Mobile Suit Gundam. And guess what: Em and Jackson are going to watch every single one. Hitting every wednesday for any and all patreon subscribers, we watch two episodes of anime every week and break down our feelings on them for you all. Newcomers are taking the ride with us, and fans of Gundam are enjoying our hilariously incorrect theories in the face of not knowing forty years of lore. If you‚Äôre a Gundam fan, come on down to our , and join in on the dramatic irony.


I'm glad you asked! We've been very fortunate to have Abnormal Mapping not only pay for itself but allow us to get a website good enough to support more shows than we have the physical capacity to produce. So we figured we would pay it forward and give people a place to put their podcasts that wouldn't cost any money and is reliable. Podcasting is a good populist medium that should be for everyone, but the one big cost is absolutely hosting on something that isn't archive.org, so we're happy to be the home for shows that need a place to stay, with nearly no strings attached.

If you'd think you'd have a good fit for our network, then  for everything you need to know. If you clear the very light guidelines then we'd be more than happy to give you a space to host your show! We already have one great show, , hosted by long-time friends of Abnormal Mapping Ryan Persaud, Allen Ibrahim, and Kaity Marie.


Absolutely! Your money not only helps support the site and keep Em and Jackson housed and fed, it also gets you an array of great rewards. You can see the rewards in the side bar, but I'm happy to spell them out for you here too!

this gets you The Great Gundam Project, a weekly podcast where Jackson and Em watch all of Mobile Suit Gundam two episodes at a time and report back on how we feel about Spacenoid liberation and whether or not Gelgoogs are cool. We are already scheduled to be doing this podcast until 2026, when we'll undoubtedly begin a classic Dr Who show or something equally ludicrous (don't hold us to this). If you want a sample of The Great Gundam Project we have two free episodes for the beginning of Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam that you can find  and .

every Saturday Jackson and Em trade off writing the Patreon Letters, a series of informal criticism, essays, and the odd bit of fiction about media and life. Previous topics have covered new games we'd never cover on Abnormal Mapping, living under late capitalism, discourse on Star Wars, and many other things besides. The odd Patreon Letter finds itself free on our Medium (you can see the ones released so far ), but we're proud of all of them and think they're writing worth supporting!

we're launching a NEW PODCAST at this tier. People always say they enjoy our rapport as hosts and wish we'd just goof around and so we're bringing you VoIP Life! Once every two weeks we'll offer you things that hit the cutting room floor, good times goofing around on Skype, and other weird things that would never make our more formal shows. We've literally never interacted in person and thus our entire friendship has been over Skype and Slack and Discord, so we'll keep the microphones on a little longer and offer you the best dumb time we can mustre.

People love our podcasts. Some people love them so much they want to wear them, like a fur coat. If you're that person you can be on any of our podcasts for the low low cost of $20 a month for six months. We'll let you pick the podcast, pick the topic, and create on of our shows where you're our special guest or‚Äîif you're not comfortable podcasting‚Äîwe talk about the thing you've set us on. This is an expensive tier, but we think our shows are worth it, and we have loved having every guest we've had on in the past.

And that's everything! Thank you so much for your consideration and your support, and we hope you get as much from our many shows as we get from producing them for you! "

Heroes and history buffs beware - on the Sabaton History Channel we cover the real history behind one Sabaton song every week. Indy Neidell of The Great War and World War Two will guide you through the historical background and the guys in the band will tell you what their songs meant for Sabaton - and there will be loads of music of course. We, Sabaton, are a Swedish metalband with a great love for history. Almost all of our songs are about military history, and now this channel is here to explain the story behind them. 

We need your help to cover all the songs
We want this show to go on for a long time so that we can cover as many songs as possible and we want to do that together with you. Every week you can interact with us and our team in the comment section on YouTube. Every other month we will be live on the Sabaton History Channel together with Indy to answer any questions you might have for us about the history, the song and... well, anything you want to ask. 

Be a member of Sabaton History
If you want to have a front-row seat for all of that and support us to make this an awesome and huge project - join us here by selecting one of our. Not only will you be part of the force that keeps us rolling - you will also get some exclusive benefits only available for our Sabaton History members.

When our comes out we will make a  for some of the membership tiers available here. Aditionally, we will compile  with songs that we feel strongly about and would love you to hear. If you're really bold you can become a Sabaton History Commander or Sabaton Knight and get a chance to put yourself on the for one of our headline shows. Check out our membership tiers here on the page, they rockü§ò!

This has been a dream of ours for many, many years. As you know, we write songs about heroes, battles, and wars from the past, but there's only so much you can cover in one song. We want to share the in the first place with you all, and Sabaton History is our chance to do exactly that. We'll dive into the history but we will also explain what that particular song means to us, how we came up with the initial idea, and share some amazing stories (some are truly epic!) about our experiences around the song. Thing is, that it's only now that we're in a position to even think of doing this, and in the end we need you to participate so that we can keep investing time and money into this awesome channel together. We will use the money to hire producers, historians, researchers, a motion designer for the maps, editors, writers and of course Indy Neidell. We wouldn't be able to do this without them, so get involved with the project and join us by choosing one of our membership tiers! 

Simply put: one of the coolest historians you can find anywhere. He wrote and hosted the entire story of the First World War week by week, blow by blow for four years on The Great War Channel and now he's doing the same for  for the span of six years, together with Spartacus Olsson, Astrid Deinhard and their crew at TimeGhost. Indy is also an actor and professional musician, so he understands the whole scope of what we do. A couple of years back P√§r and Indy met when P√§r was a guest on Indy's WWI show, and when we decided that it was time to finally do this it was a natural thing to reach out to Indy and his partners. They loved the idea too and... well, the rest is soon going to be history. "

Astonishing Legends , a podcast on the strange and unusual (astonishinglegends),"1,327",,,1785,Nov 2015,"Hello! We are Scott Philbrook and Forrest Burgess. A few years ago we realized that whenever we got together with friends or pretty much anywhere, we would wind up talking in depth about great mysteries. We both have a passion for them and once we figured out we each had more than a cursory knowledge of the unknown, we thought that we might have a good idea for a podcast, and Astonishing Legends was born. If you've never heard us, check out episodes 23 and 24 where we thoroughly cover the infamous Dyatlov Pass Incident and you'll find out why our listeners call us the 'Click and Clack of esoterica.'

We launched in October of 2014, and we couldn't wait to share the 1000 plus stories we'd collectively saved. Since then we've had over 50 million downloads and climbed as high as number 22 on the iTunes charts for all podcasts. Prior to launching we searched for shows that most closely resembled what we wanted to do and to our surprise, we found that there weren't any, at least not like us. We are both interested in mixed topics, similar to those old TV shows, Unsolved Mysteries and, In Search Of. We wanted to go further than they had though, and we also wanted to lighten the whole genre up. If a guest tells us a giant demon with wings popped out of a bush in their backyard and flew into the woods, nothing can stop us from cracking a few jokes about that. However, we're not above scaring our listeners when it's called for.

We've set this Patreon page up because what we're doing is not without its costs and we want to keep doing it. Podcasting itself is still in its infancy, and a lot of folks aren't even sure you can make a living at it, but 3 years in now, it would appear we might just be able to do that. We're not trying to get rich, we just want to keep doing the show and we want it to be the only job the two of us have. There are no high-powered networks or radio professionals behind our show. We are the underdog; pulling ourselves up out of the muddy sea of over 750,000 podcasts. With the help of Patrons such as yourself we can bring Astonishing Legends to the masses, and possibly even start to dig out of the financial hole we've dug for ourselves.

Our show is not changing, it will stay free! Patreon is not about paying for what you're currently getting for free, it's about supporting something you enjoy and making it possible for us to keep doing it. However, Patrons at various levels will have exclusive access tolike our andormonthly Patrons at $10 and above will get exclusive access to Read the pledge levels below for details on all of it, we are excited about it!

We are eternally grateful for the outpouring of support we've already received from our ever expanding community of listeners that hail from all over the world. If you're one of those people, thank you. We are hoping that you will now become a patron. Your support will give us a chance to do more research and produce the show more frequently. We want to be the show you can't wait to hear when you need a distraction from your workout, commute, or the voices in your head. In fact, WE want to be the voices in your head. 

If you haven't heard us you can find us on , ,  or , or just about any other podcast aggregator, not to mention our official website where there's a ton of extra links and episode information for each show at .

Digital Foundry , a 4K gaming video platform (digitalfoundry),"1,327","$5,667 per month",$4.27 per month,1429,Nov 2016,"Digital Foundry specialises in technical analysis of gaming hardware and software, using state-of-the-art capture systems and bespoke software to show you how well games and hardware run, visualising precisely what they're capable of.

In essence, video really is at the core of everything we do, and we use YouTube to distribute our graphics comparisons, frame-rate tests and tech analysis, while our written work is found at Eurogamer. 

But there's a problem we need to address. We create our work to the most exacting standards and YouTube is unable to provide a platform to see our videos at the best quality, owing to a lack of bandwidth. It's a great platform for convenient viewing, but at 1080p, often you don't see the full picture with fast action lost in a sea of macroblocks, and with the arrival of PlayStation 4 Pro and the latest top-tier PC graphics cards, YouTube is unable to fully capture the 4K experience. You can stream ultra HD for sure, but much of the precision detail is lost - and that's really the whole point of 4K in the first place.

The bottom line is this: we need a new video delivery system where we aren't as constrained as we are by streaming bandwidth. We need a platform to be able to show you  and at the same time, we can use this system to deliver pristine quality 1080p video too.

, and we've chosen a high quality provider to ensure fast downloads, but the bottom line is that bandwidth isn't free, so we will need to charge a small monthly access subscription fee - but $5 is a small price to pay for unlimited access to and it's also a way to show support for what we do.




Digital Foundry has analysed games for nine years now and everything we produce has always been free to view, whether it's video on YouTube or articles on Eurogamer. - but if you want to see our video content at its best, subscribing to our video download service is the way forward.

Here's a quick FAQ, and we'll update with any further questions you may have!


We use a video encoding technique based on the idea of a constant quality level. Typically, the more complex the image, and the more motion there is and the more bandwidth used. It ensures a consistent level of image quality throughout and keeps file-size bloat down. We'll be using the h.264 codec, along with a second HEVC option, both using the MP4 container. As a rough ballpark figure, a 4K 60fps video file can be as much as 500MB per minute of footage, with HEVC running at around half that.1080p will be much lower! We are still looking to optimise our encoding to keep file-sizes down without unduly compromising quality.


Our standard 1080p60 videos should work just fine on any modern computer without too much effort, using the media player of your choice. However, 4K video - especially at 60fps - may require a more powerful computer, or a better media player. For 4K TV owners, we recommend copying our videos onto a USB 3.0 flash drive and running them directly on your TV. Most modern branded 4K TVs should be able to run our videos without issue. In terms of the h.264/HEVC split, most most screens should be able to handle our HEVC content easily.





No, your media player should automatically downscale the video. 


No.


No.


Initially we didn't offer this option, but we've mastered the workflow now and offer occasional HDR video. We aim to do a lot more in 2018, but this is going to involve purchasing more equipment - something that this Patreon helps with handily. You can see all of our existing HDR content . As with our other content, HDR videos are also hosted on YouTube, though right now there is limited playback support. We recommend downloading our HDR videos, copying them to a USB stick and plugging that directly into your TV for playback.


In the time that we've been running this Patreon, we've offered a small range of raw capture and trailers. Essentially, when we have cool extra stuff to share, we add it.  is the current range of Patreon goodies we've uploaded.


Primarily you are paying for the bandwidth used for the video downloads. This is not insignificant bearing in mind the high bit-rates we are using. We're offering this option because so much effort goes into producing high quality video and it's a genuine shame that you don't get to see the content as we produced it.

Greetings, traveler, thank you very much for visiting my Patreon page!

My name is George and I've been DMing for my group of friends for quite a few years now.  In addition to gaming I also I like to create artwork whenever I can so I decided to bring two of my biggest passions‚Äìtabletop gaming and art‚Äìtogether to create Dice Grimorium, a project where I produce battle maps and tokens for fantasy role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder.

These battle maps and tokens are a great visual aid for any Dungeon Master looking to create or bridge adventures quickly and easily and as such I try my best to make them able to fit nicely into any preexisting campaign. This doesn't mean I won't be doing more specific environments from time to time though!

Here are some examples of my work:



My goal is to create 2-4 battle maps per month which will be freely available for all, while patrons will get access to files, as well as of it. These alternate versions include the map at different times of day, such as night or afternoon, or different color palettes. For patrons who have pledged on the maps will also include some map tokens that make up each map, such as trees, rocks, houses, etc.

Below you can find some of the cool stuff you can get once you become a Patron!





For a more detailed description of what you can get by pledging please refer to the Tiers section on this page.

Thank you for having a look around!"
Black Magic Craft , D&D terrain building videos (blackmagiccraft),"1,303",,,1361,Jan 2017,"Hi friend, 

It is my mission to share with you the techniques, tricks, and methods that I've developed building high quality terrain for tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons. I want you to avoid the mistakes I've made, I want to test new methods and materials and show you the results both good and bad. I want you to be confident in your abilitiy to make killer terrain, and know that you too can have highly detailed and realistic pieces for your game. You can do this!

This hobby has greatly improved my life. Crafting terrain has helped me learn to cope with severe anxiety and depression. Dungeons & Dragons has helped me keep friends close, and having awesome terrain has made the game experiences with them even more memorable.

I want to help people new to the hobby by showing simple projects. I want to help long time, experienced terrain builders by showing new and unique techniques. I want to teach, but mostly I want to INSPIRE.

I love building terrain and I love sharing it with the community. I love making tutorial videos but they take a considerable amount of time and effort to do. A build video takes 25-35 hours to produce start to finish and I release one every Friday. 

If you've learned from my videos, appreciate the help I give by diligently answering your questions, or just love what I do, this is a great way for you to give back to the channel and ensure I can keep doing it.

Cheers!
Jeremy"

Kody and her sister London are back at it again, this time they take the wedgies up a notch, with Kody giving London a wedgie so hard, she's lifted off the ground.

Kody and her real life best friend, Macy are talking about humiliating things that happened to them in high school. The conversation leads to wedgies which leads to who they think can give the hardest wedgie. Then they each give each other hard wedgies so see who's the winner. Macy has never got a wedgie before, so her reactions are priceless. 

Wedgie Story: Kody's chatting with her best friend, talking about getting bullied in school by Kelli. She's subjected to a swirly then a huge ripping gang wedgie.

I'm an independent artist with a passion for making all varieties of D&D Maps. These maps might include images like battle maps, towns, cities, even maps of entire regions! However, I love the community-driven aspects of D&D and while I certainly enjoy making my own creations, I want to try and help you do the same! For that reason, part of the support provided here will help me to continue to make both Public Asset Packs for everyone's use and Booster Packs for my supporters.

Venatus is Latin for Adventure. I always strive to achieve a balance for that sense of adventure and possibility present in quality maps and assets while also ensuring that they're functional and pragmatic for the Game Masters using them. My hope is that through either using the maps I create here or through making your own maps with the help of the assets I make, that I'll be able to help you instill that same sense of adventure.

First of all, thank you for considering supporting me and the content I produce here. If you're new to Patreon, this page helps to facilitate individuals to pay whatever they're comfortable with in relatively small amounts for the maps I create. If you choose to become a patron, you'll need to select one of the above tiers that supports each map I create. I have released every month since the inception of this patreon over three years ago and have no plans to change that output. If for some reason I fail to release any maps or am below my average threshold you will not be billed. .


Upon signing up you will get from the month of your registration (). You will also get access to every d&d map made for Wizards of the Coast modules I‚Äôve ever created (Ravenloft, Lost Mine of Phandelver, Storm King‚Äôs Thunder, Dragon Heist, etc.) You do not pay for those separately, instead your support goes towards the maps (you are billed one time at the end of each month). I make sure to keep a frequently updated and accessible master post of all of those maps collected together for easy downloading. If you'd like to see a complete history of every map I've released so far accompanied by preview images, take a look at the post on our subreddit.

Enjoy my d&d maps, but the Patreon model not for you? No problem. While the consistent, month-to-month support I receive here is invaluable and there are several patreon-exclusive perks for my patrons (like exclusive access to the last 6 months‚Äô worth of maps), the majority of my past content can also be found on our website: . There you can shop around, pick just the maps you want, and easily purchase them without having to worry about month-to-month costs. You can also find low-resolution copies of every map on our or on our page.

Spencer Krug , - S O N G S - (spencerkrug),"1,274",,,629,Jan 2019,"Here is where I post a new song every month; written and recorded by me, not released anywhere else, and completed just days if not hours before being posted. I include a little write-up about where the music is coming from as well, for anyone interested in that sort of thing. Accessing these posts is $1 per month, and if get caught up staring at the wall and miss a month I‚Äôll pause the campaign so nobody gets charged.

Why am I doing this?

Over the past fifteen years I have made a lot of records (nineteen LPs and eight EPs according to wikipedia, wtf) with a number of projects; Wolf Parade, Moonface, Sunset Rubdown, and Swan Lake being the most relevant to me. And while I‚Äôm grateful for all that experience, I‚Äôve always been frustrated by the huge and kind of pointless amount of time it takes for the music to get to your ears after it leaves my hands. By the time you‚Äôve decided whether you love or hate a thing, I've stopped thinking about it entirely. This long gap is because the music industry likes to work, for better or for worse, in a particular way. But the disconnect puts you the music fan, and me the songwriter, in very different places when considering the same music, and I think it‚Äôd be better if we could hear things from more or less the same place. I love the idea of posting a new song, one that represents where I‚Äôm at artistically that very day, knowing that people will hear it instantly. I love the idea of touring material that‚Äôs as fresh to me as it is to the audience. So the above-mentioned time gap is one that I am trying to close here.

I‚Äôm not abandoning completely the idea of whole albums. I‚Äôll continue to write and release LPs with Wolf Parade, or any other project / time wherein it makes the most sense to work that way. But right now the common paradigm of slowly compiling songs, recording them all at once, releasing them on a label six months later and then taking them on tour‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs just no longer a model that makes sense for me, artistically or financially. The way that I want to engage with and represent my solo work has changed, so I'm leaving old models behind. This is me trying a new kind of way.

What sort of music will I be posting?

In 2019 the new songs I posted here each month consisted mostly of piano and voice. Sometimes I played an old synth instead of piano, sometimes I added digital rhythms or strings, another singer, or random effects, but for the most part I was trying to keep it simple. I wanted to revisit the challenges / rewards that came with making the Moonface LP ‚ÄúJulia with Blue jeans On‚Äù in 2013, an album made solely with live piano & vocals, as well as the ‚ÄúCity Wrecker‚Äù EP made the following year. Returning to acoustic piano in 2019, here on Patreon, and then for some subsequent touring, was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in a while. There‚Äôs a dreamy energy in a real piano I still can‚Äôt find anywhere else.

That said, now in 2020, the style of songs I post here will drift from piano and become more varied. I am about to start touring again with Wolf Parade, and with less access to my little home studio, the instrumentation of each song will depend on where I am that month. While traveling I‚Äôll be exploring more portable ways to write and record (laptops, digital stuff, maybe guitar, I don‚Äôt know - still vocals though), and when I‚Äôm back home I‚Äôll probably lean back into keys, acoustic and analog instruments. I‚Äôve always made albums that differ stylistically from one another, and now, sharing songs with you one at a time as I write them, employing a creative process which includes the listener as much as possible, I‚Äôll be slowly making an album not just stylistically different from the last, but wherein every song is its own little beast. Could be cool. And then, in 2021, we‚Äôll go forward‚Ä¶

is for those who want to keep things simple and only hear new material. The monthly song, as described above, is here for $1 / month.

But if you're interested, there's more:

is for anyone who wants to hear the new track described above, plus a little something extra; a note-full surprise. Unreleased recordings and demos which have not yet seen the light of the internet, new piano versions of old songs, recorded concerts, and whatever else I sincerely believe is worthy (I promise it will never just be a photo of me at the beach), are posted monthly to this tier. And of course I add a description about the origin and makeup of the content.

contains everything in tiers 1 and 2, plus livestream concerts performances, brought to you via crowdcast from my home studio. These are patreon-exclusive shows. Most will be solo piano, but I hope to bring other instruments / players into the mix as well. They will be performed live every-other month (the first being August 30, 2020), and remain posted to crowdcast so patrons can watch them anytime.
On the alternate months, I post compiled clips of improvised music. Let me explain: Every once in a while I sit down at the piano and improvise for 20 minutes - a kind of zen-out meditation exercise I indulge in - and record it. Sometimes the little ideas documented in these improvisations are the seeds of whole songs. For the interested fan, there is a lot music in these recordings that is never heard by anyone except me, so I thought it could be cool to post 5-10 minute compilations of the more inspired moments. To be clear, this is just instrumental music, completely improvised, with no vocals whatsoever. And I am not a jazz guy; you won‚Äôt hear any informed modal exploration. Nor am I even technically very good at piano, as in, there are definitely some rogue notes, bonus tones, skronkers. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù music. But you‚Äôll hear me kind of searching around for ideas, or zoning out to the repetition of whatever groove I happen to find that day, and this can make for interesting listening. Sometimes they are unedited performances, but more often they are edited compilations. I try to cut them together as artfully as possible for those that join this tier.

If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. If you decide to subscribe and help support this musical experiment, then thanks even more. As I explained above, I‚Äôve decided to move my solo work away from record labels, so any money made here can now help with things like pressing vinyl, subsidizing tours, future recordings, and me continuing to exist as an artist in general. And of course I hope you like the music! Made by me, it will be a little strange, but honest.

Sincerely,
Spencer Krug"
Wong Fu Productions , Films & Web Series (wongfuproductions),"1,273",,,966,Feb 2018,"When we first started Wong Fu Productions, we had no expectations. We weren't expecting to be well known or popular. We weren't expecting to be role models or a voice for Asian Americans in media. We weren't even expecting to get paid!
A lot has changed since those simple days in the mid-2000s. Most for the better! We've created hundreds of videos that have touched millions of peoples' lives around the world. We've worked with countless talented and good-hearted creators. We even made a movie! It's been an amazing ride that we're infinitely grateful for.
But a lot has also changed to make things harder for channels like us to exist. Many creators on the space are just trying to shock and click-bait their way to popularity to make millions of dollars from ads. Big corporations and even celebrities have crossed into the YouTube space, and smaller channels like us have been pushed aside.
Thankfully we've been able to adapt, and with the support of our fans, we've continued to be the channel you know and love, putting quality before quantity, story before sensation, through all these obstacles. And for the most part, we can continue to do this, the same way. But we want to do so much more!



Our core values have always been to put quality before quantity and passion before popularity, and above all representing Asian Americans positively. In the current digital and social landscape, maintaining these values is becoming more and more challenging. With clickbait, funky algorithms, and youtube drama, WFP is becoming isolated in our integrity and style of content.
This is why now more than ever, individual support is necessary to keep us going. Wong Fu wants to continuing making the content that NEEDS to exist in order to progress the Asian American community. So our goals are pretty simple...


One goal leads to another, so you'll be amazed how far your monthly contribution can go!
It's time for us to take action into our own hands instead of relying on Youtube, or sponsors, or passing trends. 



We have all these goals! Why can't we just do them now??
Wong Fu already works around the clock JUST to keep the channel going as it has been the past 10 years. One sketch a month, maybe one series a year, a weekly Lunch Break, and that's it. That's all we can do with the team, crews, and bills we're paying. That's all we can do with the money we're generating through sporadic brand deals and an unpredictable Adsense payment.
Patreon would allow us to rely less on those revenue streams, and give us more to work with so that we can take on these new ventures!
If you have the means to contribute, that's great; we'd love for you to join our community. And anytime you feel like you want to pause/end your membership, no worries! Everything will help!



Like all new big ventures that need public support, there are ""shareholders"". But in our case, instead of each contributor possessing a share, they possess ""care"". You care about seeing Wong Fu continue and expand. You care about Wong Fu being a part of your life and other people's lives. Now we want to show you we care about you by making the best possible content with your contribution. Thank you for your generosity, your confidence, and your care! We won't let you down!"
ShadyPenguinn , Video Game Content (ShadyPenguinn),"1,273",,,594,Feb 2019,"I'm so lucky. I don't know what I did to deserve the opportunities I've been given, but I will never be able to express how blessed I am.

What's going on shady people? You might know me as ShadyPenguinn, a content creator who strives to bring good medicine in the form of video game content. Beyond the internet, I've been lucky enough to work as contracted talent for the Pokemon company, and other game studios like Snow Leopard. 

This Patreon is a huge step for me, as this is the first time I am creating exclusive, premium content. This is mostly in part of the YouTube landscape changing drastically, but is also heavily influenced by changes in my life, like being a husband, home owner, and most recently, father. My goals, dreams, and expectations for my life have changed over the six years I've been creating content online, and this feels like the destination it's been building up to.

I want you to know my intentions with this! I intend to upload a video every single day that will be exclusively viewable on Patreon. How? I will be uploading videos to YouTube on a random channel, make them unlisted, and embedding them in our posts here on Patreon. I will most likely be recording 3-4 videos per recording session, and doing 2-3 sessions a week!

I'm really excited for things to come. The fact that you've read this far, and are potentially interested in my content, seriously blows my mind. If you choose to support here on Patreon, I genuinely hope my content is worth your pledge. I hope to make you laugh when you're sad, happier when you're happy, and bring you good medicine when you need it most.

Laser Time , Podcast Gold (lasertime),"1,270","$7,669 per month",$6.04 per month,1933,Jun 2015,"**UPDATE!** We've enhanced our rewards and added new goals, including new shows!


-UNLOCK A NEW SHOW: The Quizdown (Sample the pilot episode now!)
-Monthly Thirty Thirty Ten Bonus Show
-Monthly Bonus Vidjagame Apocalypse bonus show
-Monthly Bonus VGA Spoilercast
-New Limited Series including Season 2 of An Elm Street Nightmare
-New Video Series

Back in 2008, a handful of nerdy editors for a major gaming website had a dream: They would goof around on microphones, post absurd articles and drink on the job. And thus, the wonderfully profane podcast known as TalkRadar was born. Hundreds of hours and thousands of amazing listeners later, best pals Chris Antista, Brett Elston, Dave Rudden and many other cool people knew they needed even more time‚Ä¶ more LASER time‚Ä¶



Since the first episode of Laser Time went live in September 2011, we‚Äôve been doing our damnedest to give you the best podcasts ever, putting to use all the esoteric knowledge we've collected from our press, publisher and entertainer backgrounds. We covered pop culture topics that ranged from the most expensive EVERYTHING to Japanese ape attacks to songs that fill us with shame, and who could forget the dirtiest Xmas music ever recorded and erotic fan fiction read with gusto? Despite having full-time jobs, we worked hard to make the ever-evolving show as fun as it could be.

And it kept growing. 2012 saw the additions of the weekly comic book show, Cape Crisis, the game music show VGMpire and the dedicated wrestling program, Cheap Popcast. In 2013 Vidjagame Apocalypse gave LT listeners a dedicated gaming show in the grand TalkRadar style. And thanks to YOU and YOUR contributions to our Patreon, we added two huge new shows to the roster - Talking Simpsons and Thirty Twenty Ten.


All this in addition to streams, articles, and loads of custom videos, all housed on lasertimepodcast.com. And it‚Äôs all because you and your continued support. So let's keep it going, shall we?

Our Patreon has seen its fair share of alterations since it went live in June 2015, but we‚Äôre still cranking out the content and you all continue to step up and be the coolest, most responsive and patient fans of any podcast on Patreon. Our tiers and rewards have changed informally, but now we‚Äôve updated the page to more accurately reflect what it is you receive.



The biggest soft benefit for anyone over the $5 level is ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù content that we post in the Patreon feed. Could be game streams, extra Cheap Popcasts, bonus commentaries or even a look at new video content before anyone else sees it. We don‚Äôt have a set schedule or pitch in mind, we just post it when possible / something strikes us.

We arrived at this arrangement because over the past year it became clear we were making TOO MUCH STUFF. So we‚Äôre down to a show a day, streams, bonus shows, and then whatever else we‚Äôre able to get done. Who knows what it might bring in 2018!



If helping us was too complex before, if you were waiting for us to do a Patreon, if you were on the fence before, now, now, NOW is the time to make this work. We have so many plans for the future - just look at all those milestones! - and you can make them come true.

So check out the different tiers of support and give whatever you can! Then tell a friend, tell your mom, and tell your worst enemy, Daryll! Let everyone know that Laser Time needs all the help it can get to become the world conquering juggernaut we want it to be! And we know we can do this together!

Love,
Everyone at Laser Time!

About me

I'm Faerin, a long time game developer and allround game enthusiast.
I have been planning to create my own games for many years, but life got in the way and it just never happened. That all changed a few years ago, when I decided to set up this Patreon page and start development of my own first game!

My games

After working full-time for about two years on ""Man of the House"" I finished the main version, which is now available for purchase on Steam for both Windows and Mac!

Since the start of October 2019, I have been working on my second game: Mystwood Manor
__________________________________________________________________________________

In Mystwood Manor you play as a young adult who finds himself in charge of a very old and mysterious hotel, due to some ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù events.

You will hire, train and manage your staff, build new facilities and upgrade your hotel to meet your customers‚Äô demands. Each girl on your staff will have her own unique personality and backstory.
As you progress each of their storylines you will find out more about them and get to know them inside and out...

Will you be able to unravel the mysteries of Mystwood, while running and growing your hotel business? Get ready for a new adventure, filled with dark secrets, shocking plot twists and most of all, lots and lots of hot, steamy sex!

Mystwood Manor is currently only available for windows (though you can play it on Mac using Wine).


New updates are being released every month!

Hello to everyone! I'm gonna tell you something about my Patreon experience! It's difficult to explain some things with my english, but I'll try! I just want to be honest and clear!
Reading this maybe you'll understand something about this complicated site! 

I'm here on patreon since 2015, and things were veeery different! 
At that time I used to make my rewards IMMEDIATELY visible after the subscription!
It was fast and fair from my point of view!
BUT THEN...someone started to decline the pledge before the end of the month...and I was like ""whaaat, but they saw all the exclusive contents! what do I do now?? D': ""

So I started to give the rewards with a private message after Patreon processes all the pledges ""at the beginning of the NEXT month""! but I don't like it..people is forced to wait  for a long time...that's why now I always give a welcome gift to my new patrons!

Presently I am on a different kind of adventure.  Living in my custom built minivan camper.  I have already documented the first year of that experience on YouTube.  During that time period I was living in the city and working full time at a factory.  I had to deal with many struggles of city life and also the cold weather.

In August of 2019 I decided to take the real plunge!  I quit my job and drove to western Canada for some new adventures.  While I was out there something incredible happened, my YouTube channel finally took off.  One video changed everything, Living in a Minivan during Freezing Temperatures.  As of right now I consider YouTube video production as my full time career.  What does that mean exactly?  It means I have to dream up the craziest adventures possible!

FAQ - Billing & Dates




Hey! I‚Äôm Michael, and I‚Äôve been running BellularGaming since 2013. It‚Äôs been quite the journey so far. With Battle for Azeroth on the horizon, it‚Äôs time to work harder than ever on bringing you World of Warcraft content.
Things are here have changed a lot over the past year with the death of WoW Tales and renewed focus on the channel. The level of support has been truly astounding.

Making high quality content that respects your time is our core mission. To that end we (‚Ä¶yes, we!) are always working on making things better. Producing more content, and content that is of a higher quality. Recently this has involved integrating Machinima into our videos, re-building a recording studio, working with a part time cinematographer and revamping our entire sound setup.

It‚Äôs a tonne of work for a gaming channel, but we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. I mean hell, fancy cameras and machinima segments are damn fun to make! It does all take a lot of time though. Patreon is the best place to support what we do and be better connected with the community.


Over the last year I've tried to diversify the channel & create more unique, personal content. News is great, and I still do that, but there's so much else to talk about. Here's what I do:
I strive to maintain a 3 videos per week schedule that's got something for everyone, so ideally a mix of video types. Of course the World of Warcraft is always changing, and I often meme myself far past 3 per week ;)


Patreon allows for security and stability, which enables me to hire people on to help work on the channel. The major improvements of the last year, such as the lore and documentary style videos, have pretty much been because of that. Patreon is also an awesome place for me to engage with you early by field testing new concepts & getting your take on things."

Covid-19 has meant it cannot open it's doors - or can only do so at 1/3 capacity. To remain a live, viable, Comedy club it needs ¬£14,750 a month (That's rent of ¬£5000 a month, bills of ¬£750 a month and staff costs of ¬£9,000 a month - even on reduced wages) 

The good news is that all it needs is a little support.

A cup of tea a month from just 5% of people that have come through our doors in 2020 alone will help us.

WHO WE ARE:



Angel Comedy runs 7 nights a week in Angel, Islington, with a LOT of free shows, but it also  has bills of Stand up, Sketch, improv from new and established performers. 

Angel Comedy provides a stage and work for more comedians than any other single venue in the country. It is totally independent and community funded. It gives a stage to everyone from Eddie Izzard to people doing their first ever stand up gig. Something that no other venue in the country can claim. And it puts on  shows every single night of the week,  workshops every week.

Support Angel Comedy and the rewards will be manifold - not only will you help a one-of-a-kind and community focussed venue stay alive, but you'll also be of a community and will have get insight and extra footage and material that others just don't get to see"

Also included with The Northwood Lair project is a 2.5D beta adult side scrolling adventure game!

On the outskirts of your secret lair lies the Overworld, a place where you can travel to for commercial entertainment. Here your submissive playmate can dance in minimal attire that accents all of her best features in full view of the public, or accompany them behind the nearest building while you entertain yourself with the other erotic merchants! Visit the local tavern for a drink, or strike up a conversation with one of the girls and fill your night with their company in any way you wish!






Your lair has many locations to visit for your servants training. Have her entertain your henchmen in a prison cell, perform magical summons in the Arcanium with tentacle monsters, relax and unwind in a hot bath, and more!






In addition to the full 3D adult segments that you may freely enjoy as much as you wish, a Story Mode is in development in a hybrid Visual Novel x 3D style, mixing 3D turn based combat and exploration with story-telling narratives. All of the best parts of each type element are included for an exciting mix that tells the tale of The Northwood Lair. Visual novel elements can have dangerous consequences when faced with multiple branching options, with Dead Ends and Bad Ends looming around every corner for yourself as the main protagonist. There is also many rewarding moments which bestow fully 3D H scenes and unlock lots of additional lascivious content!

Some of the textures were made from free stock textures collected from various websites, and then cropped/mixed/modified for minecraft resourcepack and shader texture format. Some were made by me using procedural texturing.

The pack takes priority of large scale texture tiling / randomization using various optifine features over having high texture res or detailed custom block models. And mostly color-matched to vanilla default textures to ensure existing builds and maps won't look too different when viewed with the pack.Grass and leaves texture are also compatible with biome coloring so they should work correctly with biome mods.

There are some special block textures that only shows up in certain situations, you can find the list included inside the addon resourcepacks

The pack is just a personal practice/test pack, so it will be updated whenever I feel like it with no set schedule. But feel free to leave a comment to suggest what textures I should do next :D"

blackjrXIII , Adult Futa Animations (blackjrXIII),"1,233","$2,907 per month",$2.36 per month,1996,Apr 2015,"So I started using Source Filmmaker around December 2013. But only making pictures and nothing more for about 2 or 3 months and then finally started animating after watching tutorials and watching my favorite SFM artist animations over and over trying to learn from them before I took the plunge into animating. Which I almost gave up on for a while but stuck with it. And then after about 6 or 7 months later I decided to start my own tumblr and share my work with the world. In hopes that people would enjoy my work as much as I do myself.

And now I have started a patreon looking for support and to help me stay animating full time."

Uncomfortable , Foundational Drawing Lessons (uncomfortable),"1,229","$6,727 per month",$5.47 per month,2046,Mar 2015,"Hi there! I'm Uncomfortable, and I run Drawabox. That includes the website (drawabox.com), the subreddit where it all began (/r/ArtFundamentals) and the YouTube channel. All of the resources are completely free. You can even submit your completed work directly on the website, or in the discord server to have other members of the community look over your work.

Using these platforms, I try to help those new to drawing, those who are primarily self-taught and those who are even vaguely interested in diving in. I do so by providing structured, exercise-based lessons that start with the very basics of how to make confident, smooth marks, explore the mechanics of drawing solid forms and ultimately build up to being able to construct complex objects by first breaking them down into their simpler components.

I stress the importance of skill developed through hard work instead of talent, and give students the resources to get started. My lessons aren't for the faint of heart - I'll admit right now, especially at the beginning there's a lot of tedious work, and you are made to walk a road paved with mistakes and failures. Failure isn't just important, it's necessary. While our successes show us how far we've come, it is through our failures that we continue to move forwards.


As of February 2020, the Patreon tiers have been integrated into the website itself - every time you're charged, you'll have  added on the website. Even if you don't have an account there, it's all tied to your Patreon identity - so once you're ready to receive critiques, all you have to do is make an account on Drawabox.com and connect it to your Patreon account,  just make things super simple by logging in with your Patreon account in the first place."

Because we don't charge for reviews like the vast majority of YouTube channels, we rely on our viewers for support. We need your help.

Youtube has placed gun channels in a restricted category, decimating our ad revenue.  As long as TFBTV generates enough revenue to cover its own costs, we can keep making videos.

You Can't Buy These Patches, But You Can Earn Them:



($30+ Lifetime Support) After $30 lifetime patronage, you earn the red and white ""Writer's Patch"", which is the patch that writers for The Firearm Blog wear at shows and media events to identify each other. You're a part of the team, too.

($60+ Lifetime Support) The exclusive OD/Black TFB patch. You can't buy this patch - it's only available for TFB Patreon supporters.

(Each $100 Lifetime Support) After $100 in support, you earn the TFB ""secret"" patch. It changes every 100 patches! Only people who work for TFB and people with the patch know what this looks like.














The story of  and  starts in 2007 years ago when The Firearm Blog began as a small blog with one rule: ""Guns, Not Politics"", creating a space online where guns could be discussed free of flame-wars and political debates.

TFB is now the largest gun-related blog on the internet.

In January 2015, we launched TFBTV, a Youtube channel with the same ""guns, not politics"" ethos of TFB. TFBTV now has hundreds of millions of views and hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Jay Foreman , educational videos (jayforeman),"1,226",,,1240,May 2017,"Hello, my name's Jay Foreman and I make silly educational videos on YouTube.

My previous video serieses include Unfinished London (about London's transport infrastructure), Politics Unboringed (about how the UK's political system works), and Map Men (about maps with fellow mapthusiast and comedian Mark Cooper-Jones)

I also sometimes upload material from my live shows, where I sing funny songs.

I want to keep making videos, but they cost lots and lots of money to make -  camera/kit hire, insurance, props, costumes, and time. Especially time. Time is by far the most expensive item. It takes ages and ages to write, storyboard, plan, shoot, and especially edit videos. And all that time is time spent not doing a proper job where I'd earn money for things like rent and pasta. 

So that's where you come in. With your help, I'll be able to turn my hobby into my job and I'll be able to upload much more videos, of much higher quality. I've got loads more video ideas and I can't wait to share them all with you. 

Even $1 per month will make a difference, and I'll be eternally grateful.

Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you please! :)"

Making my style of video is more expensive and time consuming than most people would guess, especially at the pace I work. I am a slow human.

Carlos Maza , left-wing nonsense (CarlosMaza),"1,219",,,249,Jan 2020,"What are you?
I'm a writer and video producer creating videos about propaganda in media. I used to produce a video series called ""Strikethrough"" at Vox, and have angered some of the worst people on the internet. Ted Koppel once called me a ""marxist pig"" to my face, but I'm pretty sure he was being flirty.

What's happening?
I'm creating long-form video essays about media manipulation. Which is a very sexy way of saying I'm making videos about how to detect and resist bullshit, whether its on cable news, social media, or YouTube. I try to be funny and entertaining while using simple demonstrations to help break down big concepts. Think of it like taking a ""media literacy"" class, except the professor is also a student and keeps trying to get the class to grab their pitchforks and burn the place to the ground.

There's not a lot of room in corporate media for long-form video essays, especially ones that are explicitly anti-capitalist and anti-fascist. But I think that this kind of work -- helping people think critically about the media they consume -- is super important. So I decided to go independent, and I hope that a small group of dedicated patrons will help me keep producing the kind of work I really care about."
